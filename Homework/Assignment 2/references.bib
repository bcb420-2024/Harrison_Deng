  abstract = {HIV-1 full-length RNA (HIV-1 RNA) plays a central role in viral replication, serving as a template for Gag/Gag-Pol translation and as a genome for the progeny virion. To gain a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of HIV-1 replication, we adapted a recently described system to visualize and track translation from individual HIV-1 RNA molecules in living cells. We found that, on average, half of the cytoplasmic HIV-1 RNAs are being actively translated at a given time. Furthermore, translating and nontranslating RNAs are well mixed in the cytoplasm; thus, Gag biogenesis occurs throughout the cytoplasm without being constrained to particular subcellular locations. Gag is an RNA binding protein that selects and packages HIV-1 RNA during virus assembly. A long-standing question in HIV-1 gene expression is whether Gag modulates HIV-1 RNA translation. We observed that despite its RNA-binding ability, Gag expression does not alter the proportion of translating HIV-1 RNA. Using single-molecule tracking, we found that both translating and nontranslating RNAs exhibit dynamic cytoplasmic movement and can reach the plasma membrane, the major HIV-1 assembly site. However, Gag selectively packages nontranslating RNA into the assembly complex. These studies illustrate that although HIV-1 RNA serves two functions, as a translation template and as a viral genome, individual RNA molecules carry out only one function at a time. These studies shed light on previously unknown aspects of HIV-1 gene expression and regulation.},

  abstract = {Follicular CD8+ T cells (fCD8) mediate surveillance in lymph node (LN) germinal centers against lymphotropic infections and cancers, but the precise mechanisms by which these cells mediate immune control remain incompletely resolved. To address this, we investigated functionality, clonotypic compartmentalization, spatial localization, phenotypic characteristics, and transcriptional profiles of LN-resident virus-specific CD8+ T cells in persons who control HIV without medications. Antigen-induced proliferative and cytolytic potential consistently distinguished spontaneous controllers from noncontrollers. T cell receptor analysis revealed complete clonotypic overlap between peripheral and LN-resident HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Transcriptional analysis of LN CD8+ T cells revealed gene signatures of inflammatory chemotaxis and antigen-induced effector function. In HIV controllers, the cytotoxic effectors perforin and granzyme B were elevated among virus-specific CXCR5+ fCD8s proximate to foci of HIV RNA within germinal centers. These results provide evidence consistent with cytolytic control of lymphotropic infection supported by inflammatory recruitment, antigen-specific proliferation, and cytotoxicity of fCD8s.},

  abstract = {Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is an important transcription factor that induces the expression of antiviral genes and viral genes. NF-κB activation needs the activation of NF-κB upstream molecules, which include receptors, adaptor proteins, NF-κB (IκB) kinases (IKKs), IκBα, and NF-κB dimer p50/p65. To survive, viruses have evolved the capacity to utilize various strategies that inhibit NF-κB activity, including targeting receptors, adaptor proteins, IKKs, IκBα, and p50/p65. To inhibit NF-κB activation, viruses encode several specific NF-κB inhibitors, including NS3/4, 3C and 3C-like proteases, viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), phosphodegron-like (PDL) motifs, viral protein phosphatase (PPase)-binding proteins, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins. Finally, we briefly describe the immune evasion mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) by inhibiting NF-κB activity in productive and latent infections. This paper reviews a viral mechanism of immune evasion that involves the suppression of NF-κB activation to provide new insights into and references for the control and prevention of viral diseases.},

  abstract = {There are several currently employed classification systems for diffuse gliomas that sort tumors based on histological features. Contemporary molecular techniques, however, offer the promise of improved tumor classification and resultant patient stratification for treatment and prognosis. In particular, gene expression profiling has shown exceptional promise for providing an alternative and more objective molecular approach to glioma classification. In this study, we used cDNA array technology to profile the gene expression of 30 primary human glioma tissue samples comprising 4 different glioma subtypes as defined by current World Health Organization (WHO 2000) criteria: glioblastoma (GM, WHO grade IV), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA, WHO grade III), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO, WHO grade III), and oligodendroglioma (OL, WHO grade II). Gene expression data alone were used to group the tumors using multidimensional scaling, which is an unsupervised statistical method. Results show that impressive separation of the 4 glioma subtypes can be achieved solely on the basis of molecular data. In addition, a subcluster of 3 glioblastomas was identified as distinct from other GMs and from the oligodendroglial tumors. These 3 patients have shown extended survival compared to other GMs in the study. Survival analysis of the full data set revealed a good correlation with the molecular classification. Results of this proof-of-principle study demonstrate that molecular profiling alone can recapitulate conventional histologic classification and grading with high fidelity. In addition, results show that the molecular approach to tumor classification can generate clinically meaningful patient stratification, and, more importantly, is an efficient class-discovery tool for human gliomas, permitting the identification of previously unrecognized, clinically relevant tumor subsets.},

  abstract = {The population of HIV reservoir in infected person is very small, but extremely long-lived and is a major obstacle for an HIV cure. We previously showed that cells with established HIV latency have deficiencies in DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we investigated ability of HIV-1 to interfere with telomere maintenance, and the effects of targeting telomeres on latently infected cells. Our results show that telomeres are elongated in cultured primary memory CD4~+~T cells (TCM) after HIV-1 infection and when virus latency is established. Similarly, much longer telomeres were found in several Jurkat-derived latently infected cell lines, indicating that virus stimulates telomere elongation. Exposing primary CD4+~TCM cells to BRACO19, an agent targeting telomeres, resulted in a higher rate of apoptosis for infected cultures at day 3 post-infection, during HIV-1 latency and for PMA-stimulated cultures with low level of HIV-1 reactivation. Importantly, BRACO19 induced apoptosis in infected cells with potency similar to etoposide and camptothecin, whereas uninfected cells were less affected by BRACO19. We also determined that apoptosis induced by BRACO19 is not caused by telomeres shortening, but is related to formation of gamma-H2AX, implicating DNA damage or uncapping of telomeres, which triggers genome instability. In conclusion, our results indicate that HIV-1 stimulates telomere elongation during latency, suggesting that HIV reservoir has greater capacity for clonal expansion and extended lifespan. Higher rates of apoptosis in response to BRACO19 treatment suggest that HIV reservoirs are more susceptible to targeting telomere maintenance and to inhibitors targeting DDR, which is also involved in stabilizing telomeres.},

  abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) unspliced transcript is used both as mRNA for the synthesis of structural proteins and as the packaged genome. Given the presence of retained introns and instability AU-rich sequences, this viral transcript is normally retained and degraded in the nucleus of host cells unless the viral protein REV is present. As such, the stability of the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA must be particularly controlled in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in order to ensure proper levels of this viral mRNA for translation and viral particle formation. During its journey, the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA assembles into highly specific messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) containing many different host proteins, amongst which are well-known regulators of cytoplasmic mRNA decay pathways such as up-frameshift suppressor 1 homolog (UPF1), Staufen double-stranded RNA binding protein 1/2 (STAU1/2), or components of miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and processing bodies (PBs). More recently, the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA was shown to contain N6-methyladenosine (m6A), allowing the recruitment of YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2), an m6A reader host protein involved in mRNA decay. Interestingly, these host proteins involved in mRNA decay were shown to play positive roles in viral gene expression and viral particle assembly, suggesting that HIV-1 interacts with mRNA decay components to successfully accomplish viral replication. This review summarizes the state of the art in terms of the interactions between HIV-1 unspliced mRNA and components of different host mRNA decay machineries.},
