  abstract = {Follicular CD8+ T cells (fCD8) mediate surveillance in lymph node (LN) germinal centers against lymphotropic infections and cancers, but the precise mechanisms by which these cells mediate immune control remain incompletely resolved. To address this, we investigated functionality, clonotypic compartmentalization, spatial localization, phenotypic characteristics, and transcriptional profiles of LN-resident virus-specific CD8+ T cells in persons who control HIV without medications. Antigen-induced proliferative and cytolytic potential consistently distinguished spontaneous controllers from noncontrollers. T cell receptor analysis revealed complete clonotypic overlap between peripheral and LN-resident HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Transcriptional analysis of LN CD8+ T cells revealed gene signatures of inflammatory chemotaxis and antigen-induced effector function. In HIV controllers, the cytotoxic effectors perforin and granzyme B were elevated among virus-specific CXCR5+ fCD8s proximate to foci of HIV RNA within germinal centers. These results provide evidence consistent with cytolytic control of lymphotropic infection supported by inflammatory recruitment, antigen-specific proliferation, and cytotoxicity of fCD8s.},

  abstract = {Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is an important transcription factor that induces the expression of antiviral genes and viral genes. NF-κB activation needs the activation of NF-κB upstream molecules, which include receptors, adaptor proteins, NF-κB (IκB) kinases (IKKs), IκBα, and NF-κB dimer p50/p65. To survive, viruses have evolved the capacity to utilize various strategies that inhibit NF-κB activity, including targeting receptors, adaptor proteins, IKKs, IκBα, and p50/p65. To inhibit NF-κB activation, viruses encode several specific NF-κB inhibitors, including NS3/4, 3C and 3C-like proteases, viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), phosphodegron-like (PDL) motifs, viral protein phosphatase (PPase)-binding proteins, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins. Finally, we briefly describe the immune evasion mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) by inhibiting NF-κB activity in productive and latent infections. This paper reviews a viral mechanism of immune evasion that involves the suppression of NF-κB activation to provide new insights into and references for the control and prevention of viral diseases.},

  abstract = {Genomic experiments produce multiple views of biological systems, among them are DNA sequence and copy number variation, and mRNA and protein abundance. Understanding these systems needs integrated bioinformatic analysis. Public databases such as Ensembl provide relationships and mappings between the relevant sets of probe and target molecules. However, the relationships can be biologically complex and the content of the databases is dynamic. We demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and jointly analyze experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are encountered in making gene-to-transcript–to-protein mappings. The approach provides a flexible, programmable and reproducible basis for state-of-the-art bioinformatic data integration.},

  abstract = {There are several currently employed classification systems for diffuse gliomas that sort tumors based on histological features. Contemporary molecular techniques, however, offer the promise of improved tumor classification and resultant patient stratification for treatment and prognosis. In particular, gene expression profiling has shown exceptional promise for providing an alternative and more objective molecular approach to glioma classification. In this study, we used cDNA array technology to profile the gene expression of 30 primary human glioma tissue samples comprising 4 different glioma subtypes as defined by current World Health Organization (WHO 2000) criteria: glioblastoma (GM, WHO grade IV), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA, WHO grade III), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO, WHO grade III), and oligodendroglioma (OL, WHO grade II). Gene expression data alone were used to group the tumors using multidimensional scaling, which is an unsupervised statistical method. Results show that impressive separation of the 4 glioma subtypes can be achieved solely on the basis of molecular data. In addition, a subcluster of 3 glioblastomas was identified as distinct from other GMs and from the oligodendroglial tumors. These 3 patients have shown extended survival compared to other GMs in the study. Survival analysis of the full data set revealed a good correlation with the molecular classification. Results of this proof-of-principle study demonstrate that molecular profiling alone can recapitulate conventional histologic classification and grading with high fidelity. In addition, results show that the molecular approach to tumor classification can generate clinically meaningful patient stratification, and, more importantly, is an efficient class-discovery tool for human gliomas, permitting the identification of previously unrecognized, clinically relevant tumor subsets.},
