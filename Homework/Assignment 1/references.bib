  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an RNA virus with a large genome that encodes multiple accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus., RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm often disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport to preferentially translate their own transcripts and prevent host antiviral responses. The Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be a major inhibitor of interferon production in both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we show SARS-CoV-2-infected cells display an elevated level of nuclear mRNA accumulation compared to mock-infected cells. We demonstrate that ORF6 is responsible for this nuclear imprisonment of host mRNA, and using a cotransfected reporter assay, we show this nuclear retention of mRNA blocks expression of newly transcribed mRNAs. ORF6’s nuclear entrapment of host mRNA is associated with its ability to copurify with the mRNA export factors, Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly copurifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and presymptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also show that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 block nuclear import of a broad range of host proteins. Together, these data support a model in which ORF6 clogs the nuclear pore through its interactions with Rae1 and Nup98 to prevent both nuclear import and export, rendering host cells incapable of responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-1 family with multiple context dependent functions. We and others have shown that HIV infection is accompanied by increased circulating levels of IL-18 along with decreased levels of its antagonist, Interleukin-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP). The infection is also accompanied by intestinal inflammation and decreased intestinal integrity as measured by intestinal permeability, regeneration and repair. However, little is known concerning the relation between high level of IL-18 associated with the viral infection and intestinal permeability. Here we demonstrate that HIV treatment increases production of IL-18 and decreases that of IL-18BP production in human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. IL-18 causes apoptosis of the IEC by activating caspase-1 and caspase-3. It induces epithelial barrier hyperpermeability by decreasing and disrupting both tight and adherens junction proteins, occludin, claudin 2 and beta-catenin. Disorganization of F-actin was also observed in the IEC that were exposed to the cytokine. Moreover IL-18 decreases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Caco-2 and increases permeability in HT29 monolayers. The cells’ treatment with IL-18 causes an increase in the expression of phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light-chain (p-MLC) and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and a decrease in phosphorylated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (p-STAT)-5. This increase in p-MLC is suppressed by a Rho-kinase (ROCK)-specific inhibitor. Interestingly, the levels of the cytokine correlate with those of LPS in the circulation in three different categories of HIV infected patients (HAART-naïve and HAART-treated HIV-infected individuals, and Elite controls) as well as in healthy controls. Collectively, these results suggest that the HIV-induced IL-18 plays a role in increased intestinal permeability and microbial translocation observed in HIV-infected individuals.},

Mutations resulting in substitution of the arginine (R264) at position 2 of this epitope have been identified as escape mutations. Nineteen HLA-B*27(+) long-term nonprogressors were identified from an Australian cohort with an average follow-up of 16 y following infection. Viral and host genetic factors impacting on disease progression were determined at multiple time points. Twelve of 19 had wild-type sequences at codon 264 at all time points; 7 of 19 carried CTL escape variants. Median viral load and CD4(+) T cell counts were not significantly different between these groups at enrollment. Viral load, as judged by levels at their last visit (1,700 and 21,000 RNA copies/ml, respectively; p = 0.01) or by time-weighted area under the curve was higher in the escape group (p = 0.02). Escape mutants at other HLA-B*27-restricted epitopes were uncommon. Moreover, host polymorphisms, such as CCR5Δ32, CCR2-64I, and SDF1-3'A, or breadth of TCR repertoire responding to KK10 did not segregate to wild-type or escape groups. Host and viral factors were examined for a relationship to viral load. The only factor to affect viral load was the presence of the R264 escape mutations at the immunodominant epitope. CTL escape at R264 in the KK10 epitope is a major determinant of subsequent viral load in these HLA-B*27(+) individuals.},

They are found in many mammals and birds and have great importance for the health of humans and farm animals. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as many previous epidemics in humans that were of zoonotic origin, highlights the importance of studying the evolution of the entire CoV subfamily in order to understand how novel strains emerge and which molecular processes affect their adaptation, transmissibility, host/tissue tropism, and patho non-homologous genicity. In this review, we focus on studies over the last two years that reveal the impact of point mutations, insertions/deletions, and intratypic/intertypic homologous and non-homologous recombination events on the evolution of CoVs. We discuss whether the next generations of CoV vaccines should be directed against other CoV proteins in addition to or instead of spike. Based on the observed patterns of molecular evolution for the entire subfamily, we discuss five scenarios for the future evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, within this evolutionary context, we discuss the recently emerged Omicron (B.1.1.529) VoC.},

The innovative smart building and smart city technologies enable us to overcome these challenges by being employed through all real estate (RE) project development stages. The Evaluation Framework for Real Estate Development in Smart Cities created by the authors provides the possibility to assess the existing as well as to forecast future RE projects integration into a smart city during the whole life-cycle stage. The practical application of the presented evaluation framework was illustrated by the comparative case study. Based on the created smart building integration into a smart city evaluation framework for real estate development, 10 RE projects in Lithuania and over the world were assessed and rated by selected criteria relevant to different RE development stages. The evaluation results revealed that, especially at the design and construction stages, the existing intelligence of RE projects and/or cities is insufficient. Although real estate projects are technologically advanced as single entities, the integration into smart city networks is limited by interoperability capabilities of the cities or by different strategic goals settled by real estate developers.},

The immune response, mainly the effector mechanisms mediated by CD8+ T cells, induces the selection of mutations that allows the virus to escape the immune control. These mutations are generally selected within CD8+ T cell epitopes restricted to human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I), leading to a decrease in the presentation and recognition of the epitope, decreasing the activation of CD8+ T cells. However, these mutations may also affect cellular processing of the peptide or recognition by the T cell receptor. Escape mutations often carry a negative impact in viral fitness that is partially or totally compensated by the selection of compensatory mutations. The selection of either escape mutations or compensatory mutations may negatively affect the course of the infection. In addition, these mutations are a major barrier for the development of new therapeutic strategies focused on the induction of specific CD8+ T cell responses.},

The regulation of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression has served as a model of JAK-STAT signaling and mammalian transcriptional regulation, but to date has primarily been analyzed at the single gene level. While many aspects of ISGF3-mediated gene regulation are thought to be common features applicable to several ISGs, there are also many reports of distinct cases of non-canonical STAT1 or STAT2 signaling events and distinct patterns of co-regulators that contribute to gene-specific transcription. Recent genome-wide studies have begun to uncover a more complete profile of ISG regulation, moving toward a genome-wide understanding of general mechanisms that underlie gene-specific behaviors.},

  abstract = {Background The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused lethal infections worldwide during an unprecedented pandemic. Identification of the candidate viral epitopes is the first step in the design of vaccines against the viral infection. Several immunoinformatic approaches were employed to identify the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that bind specifically with the major histocompatibility molecules class I (MHC-I). We utilized immunoinformatic tools to analyze the whole viral protein sequences, to identify the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes responsible for binding to the most frequent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in the Egyptian population. These alleles were also found with high frequency in other populations worldwide. Results Molecular docking approach showed that using the co-crystallized MHC-I and T cell receptor (TCR) instead of using MHC-I structure only, significantly enhanced docking scores and stabilized the conformation, as well as the binding affinity of the identified SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Our approach directly predicts 7 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV-2 spike and ORF1ab protein sequence. This prediction has been confirmed by published experimentally validated and in silico predicted spike epitope. On the other hand, we predicted novel epitopes (RDLPQGFSA and FCLEASFNY) showing high docking scores and antigenicity response with both MHC-I and TCR. Moreover, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, and physicochemical properties of the predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes were evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing high efficacy of the proposed epitopes as a vaccine candidate. Conclusion Our predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes can facilitate vaccine development to enhance the immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 and provide supportive data for further experimental validation. Our proposed molecular docking approach of exploiting both MHC and TCR structures can be used to identify potential epitopes for most microbial pathogens, provided the crystal structure of MHC co-crystallized with TCR.

  abstract = {COVID-19 novel coronavirus (CoV) disease caused by severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 manifests severe lethal respiratory illness in humans and has recently developed into a worldwide pandemic. The lack of effective treatment strategy and vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 poses a threat to human health. An extremely high infection rate and multi-organ secondary infection within a short period of time makes this virus more deadly and challenging for therapeutic interventions. Despite high sequence similarity and utilization of common host-cell receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for virus entry, SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. Structure-based sequence comparison of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 illustrate three divergent loop regions in SARS-CoV-2, which is reminiscent of MERS-CoV sialoside binding pockets. Comparative binding analysis with host sialosides revealed conformational flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 divergent loop regions to accommodate diverse glycan-rich sialosides. These key differences with SARS-CoV and similarity with MERS-CoV suggest an evolutionary adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein reciprocal interaction with host surface sialosides to infect host cells with wide tissue tropism.},

  abstract = {There is considerable interest in developing immunotherapeutic approaches to elicit tumor-specific CTL responses in cancer patients. Epitope-based approaches aim to deliver the antigenic peptides or epitopes recognized by CTLs rather than the intact tumor antigen. Many tumor-associated proteins are nonmutated self proteins for which the dominant peptide epitopes are usually poorly immunogenic. The subdominant epitopes, however, can elicit robust T cell responses if optimized for their ability to bind to class I MHC molecules. Only the epitopes for a few tumor antigens expressed in human cancers have been defined to this level, mainly for technical reasons. The means to rapidly screen and characterize the binding of epitopes derived from complex tumor-associated antigens is an important enabling technology. Here, we have used the high-throughput technology iTopia™ to identify those peptides derived from the tumor-associated antigen survivin that bind 8 class I alleles. A library of overlapping nonamers spanning the length of the survivin protein was initially screened for peptides capable of binding each allele. Nineteen HLA-A*0201, zero HLA-A*0101, seven HLA-A*0301, twelve HLA-A*1101, twenty-four HLA-A*2402, six HLA-B*0702, six HLA-B*0801, and eight HLA-B*1501 binding peptides were identified based on an arbitrary cutoff. Peptides capable of binding a given allele were further characterized by their affinity for MHC class I molecules and by the rate of dissociation of the complex. This information should help guide functional studies and future epitope-based immunotherapies.

  abstract = {The tremendous majority of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data so far neglected intra-host genetic diversity. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies based on data generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of complete genomes. SARS-CoV-2 raw NGS data had been generated for nasopharyngeal samples collected between March 2020 and February 2021 by the Illumina technology on a MiSeq instrument, without prior PCR amplification. To analyze viral quasispecies, we designed and implemented an in-house Excel file (“QuasiS”) that can characterize intra-sample nucleotide diversity along the genomes using data of the mapping of NGS reads. We compared intra-sample genetic diversity and global genetic diversity available from Nextstrain. Hierarchical clustering of all samples based on the intra-sample genetic diversity was performed and visualized with the Morpheus web application. NGS mapping data from 110 SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory samples characterized by a mean depth of 169 NGS reads/nucleotide position and for which consensus genomes that had been obtained were classified into 15 viral lineages were analyzed. Mean intra-sample nucleotide diversity was 0.21 ± 0.65\%, and 5357 positions (17.9\%) exhibited significant ({$>$}4\%) diversity, in ≥2 genomes for 1730 (5.8\%) of them. ORF10, spike, and N genes had the highest number of positions exhibiting diversity (0.56\%, 0.34\%, and 0.24\%, respectively). Nine hot spots of intra-sample diversity were identified in the SARS-CoV-2 NSP6, NSP12, ORF8, and N genes. Hierarchical clustering delineated a set of six genomes of different lineages characterized by 920 positions exhibiting intra-sample diversity. In addition, 118 nucleotide positions (0.4\%) exhibited diversity at both intra- and inter-patient levels. Overall, the present study illustrates that the SARS-CoV-2 consensus genome sequences are only an incomplete and imperfect representation of the entire viral population infecting a patient, and that quasispecies analysis may allow deciphering more accurately the viral evolutionary pathways.},

ART is, however, unable to eradicate HIV, which persists latently in several cell types and tissues. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the proliferation of cells infected before ART initiation is mainly responsible for residual viremia, although controversy still exists. Conversely, it is widely accepted that drug resistance mutations (DRMs) do not appear during ART in patients with suppressed viral loads. Studies based on sequence clustering have in fact indicated that, at least in developed countries, HIV-infected ART-naive patients are the major source of drug-resistant viruses. Analysis of longitudinally sampled sequences have also shown that DRMs have variable fitness costs, which are strongly influenced by the viral genetic background.},

The reported annual incidence in the United States is 150,000 cases, but this figure has been challenged, and it may be different in Europe. Part of the reason for these uncertainties are the heterogeneity of diseases underlying ARDS and the lack of uniform definitions for ARDS. Thus, those who wish to know the true incidence and outcome of this clinical syndrome are stymied. The American-European Consensus Committee on ARDS was formed to focus on these issues and on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the process. It was felt that international coordination between North America and Europe in clinical studies of ARDS was becoming increasingly important in order to address the recent plethora of potential therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of ARDS.}

  abstract = {APOBEC3G (A3G) is a host cytidine deaminase that, in the absence of Vif, restricts HIV-1 replication and reduces the amount of viral DNA that accumulates in cells. Initial studies determined that A3G induces extensive mutation of nascent HIV-1 cDNA during reverse transcription. It has been proposed that this triggers the degradation of the viral DNA, but there is now mounting evidence that this mechanism may not be correct. Here, we use a natural endogenous reverse transcriptase assay to show that, in cell-free virus particles, A3G is able to inhibit HIV-1 cDNA accumulation not only in the absence of hypermutation but also without the apparent need for any target cell factors. We find that although reverse transcription initiates in the presence of A3G, elongation of the cDNA product is impeded. These data support the model that A3G reduces HIV-1 cDNA levels by inhibiting synthesis rather than by inducing degradation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Therapeutic HIV vaccines may prove helpful to intensify antiretroviral treatment (ART) efficacy and may be an integral part of future cure strategies. METHODS: We examined IFN-gamma ELISpot responses to a panel of 218 HIV clade B consensus-based HIV protease-reverse transcriptase peptides, designed to mimic previously described and predicted cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes overlapping drug resistance (DR) positions, that either included the consensus sequence or the DR variant sequence, in 49 ART-naïve HIV-infected individuals. Next generation sequencing was used to assess the presence of minority DR variants in circulating viral populations. RESULTS: Although a wide spectrum of differential magnitudes of response to DR vs. WT peptide pairs was observed, responses to DR peptides were frequent and strong in the study cohort. No difference between the median magnitudes of response to DR vs. WT peptides was observed. Interestingly, of the 22 peptides that were recognized by {$>$}15\% of the participants, two-thirds (64\%) corresponded to DR peptides. When analysing responses per peptide pair per individual, responses to only WT (median 4 pairs/individual) or DR (median 6 pairs/individual) were more common than responses to both WT and DR (median 2 pairs/individual; p{$<$}0.001). While the presence of ELISpot responses to WT peptides was frequently associated with the presence of the corresponding peptide sequence in the patient's virus (mean 68\% of cases), responses to DR peptides were generally not associated with the presence of DR mutations in the viral population, even at low frequencies (mean 1.4\% of cases; p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that DR peptides are frequently immunogenic and raises the potential benefit of broadening the antigens included in a therapeutic vaccine approach to immunogenic epitopes containing common DR sequences. Further studies are needed to assess the quality of responses elicited by DR peptides.},

This was a retrospective cohort study of inpatients and outpatients during the first wave of COVID-19 infection in Western Australia, March to May 2020, of the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 viral load (using the First WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA) from symptom onset, by clinical subgroups determined from the public health database and hospital records, using regression analysis. We studied 320 samples from 201 COVID-19 cases: 181 mild, seven severe, 11 critical, and four cases who died (two were also critical cases). At symptom onset the mean viral load was 4.34 log10 IU/mL (3.92–4.77 log10 IU/mL 95\% CI, cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay ORF1a Ct 28.9 cycles). The mean viral load change was –0.09 log10 IU/mL/day (–0.12 to –0.06 95\% CI). R2 was 0.08 and residual standard deviation 2.68 log10 IU/mL. Viral load at symptom onset was higher for those reporting fever compared to those not reporting fever. Viral load kinetics were not different for gender, age, shortness of breath, or those requiring oxygen. Mean viral load at usual release from isolation at 14 days was 2.5 log10 IU/mL or day 20 was 1.8 log10 IU/mL. Variability in respiratory sample SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics suggests viral loads will only have a role supporting clinical decision making, and an uncertain role for prognostication.},

  abstract = {In the last 25 years, HIV-1, the retrovirus responsible for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), has gone from being an "inherently untreatable" infectious agent to one eminently susceptible to a range of approved therapies. During a five-year period, starting in the mid-1980s, my group at the National Cancer Institute played a role in the discovery and development of the first generation of antiretroviral agents, starting in 1985 with Retrovir (zidovudine, AZT) in a collaboration with scientists at the Burroughs-Wellcome Company (now GlaxoSmithKline). We focused on AZT and related congeners in the dideoxynucleoside family of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), taking them from the laboratory to the clinic in response to the pandemic of AIDS, then a terrifying and lethal disease. These drugs proved, above all else, that HIV-1 infection is treatable, and such proof provided momentum for new therapies from many sources, directed at a range of viral targets, at a pace that has rarely if ever been matched in modern drug development. Antiretroviral therapy has brought about a substantial decrease in the death rate due to HIV-1 infection, changing it from a rapidly lethal disease into a chronic manageable condition, compatible with very long survival. This has special implications within the classic boundaries of public health around the world, but at the same time in certain regions may also affect a cycle of economic and civil instability in which HIV-1/AIDS is both cause and consequence. Many challenges remain, including (1) the life-long duration of therapy; (2) the ultimate role of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP); (3) the cardiometabolic side-effects or other toxicities of long-term therapy; (4) the emergence of drug-resistance and viral genetic diversity (non-B subtypes); (5) the specter of new cross-species transmissions from established retroviral reservoirs in apes and Old World monkeys; and (6) the continued pace of new HIV-1 infections in many parts of the world. All of these factors make refining current therapies and developing new therapeutic paradigms essential priorities, topics covered in articles within this special issue of Antiviral Research. Fortunately, there are exciting new insights into the biology of HIV-1, its interaction with cellular resistance factors, and novel points of attack for future therapies. Moreover, it is a short journey from basic research to public health benefit around the world. The current science will lead to new therapeutic strategies with far-reaching implications in the HIV-1/AIDS pandemic. This article forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, Vol. 85, issue 1, 2010.},

A joint prediction scheme where prediction of transition regions between introns and exons regulates a cutoff level for splice site assignment was able to predict splice site locations with confidence levels far better than previously reported in the literature. The problem of predicting donor and acceptor sites in human genes is hampered by the presence of numerous amounts of false positives: here the distribution of these false splice sites is examined and linked to a possible scenario for the splicing mechanism in vivo. When the presented method detects 95\% of the true donor and acceptor sites, it makes less than 0·1 \% false donor site assignments and less than 0·4\% false acceptor site assignments. For the large data set used in this study, this means that on average there are one and a half false donor sites per true donor site and six false acceptor sites per true acceptor site. With the joint assignment method, more than a fifth of the true donor sites and around one fourth of the true acceptor sites could be detected without accompaniment of any false positive predictions. Highly confident splice sites could not be isolated with a widely used weight matrix method or by separate splice site networks. A complementary relation between the confidence levels of the coding/non-coding and the separate splice site networks was observed, with many weak splice sites having sharp transitions in the coding/non-coding signal and many stronger splice sites having more ill-defined transitions between coding and non-coding.},

This study explores students’ perceptions of a gamified learning intervention deployed in a large undergraduate module and a small postgraduate module. Given the dearth of previous empirical work, an exploratory approach was used. Focus groups were carried out to develop a nuanced understanding of the students’ perceptions of a gamified learning environment. Six themes emerged: impact on learning outcomes, motivation, the importance of the stakes, group dynamics, gender and the challenges gamified learning activities present. The paper contributes by evaluating students’ perceptions of the effectiveness of gamification, providing guidelines for other practitioners deploying gamified learning interventions and identifying outstanding issues and questions that require further research.},

Regardless if they are customers, employees, patients, students, citizens, stakeholders, organizations struggle to meaningfully engage their key constituent groups who have a precious and limited resource: their time. Not surprisingly, these stakeholders have developed deflector shields to protect themselves. Only a privileged few organizations are allowed to penetrate the shield, and even less will meaningfully engage. To penetrate the shield, and engage the audience, organizations need an edge. Gamification has emerged as a way to gain that edge and organizations are beginning to see it as a key tool in their digital engagement strategy. Gamify shows gamification in action: as a powerful approach to engaging and motivating people to achieving their goals, while at the same time achieving organizational objectives. It can be used to motivate people to change behaviors, develop skills, and drive innovation. The key to gamification success is to engage people on an emotional level and motivating them to achieve their goals.},

  abstract = {TLR7 agonists are of high interest for the treatment of cancer, auto-immunity and chronic viral infections. They are known to activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce high amounts of Type I Interferon (IFN) and to facilitate T and B cell responses, the latter with the help of maturation markers such as CD40, CD80 and CD86. The TLR7 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs179008 (GLn11Leu), sex and chronic viral infection have all been reported to influence pDC IFN production. It is unknown, however, whether these factors also influence pDC phenotypic maturation and thereby IFN-independent pDC functions. Furthermore, it is unclear whether SNP rs179008 influences HBV susceptibility and/or clearance. Here we investigated whether the SNP rs179008, sex and HBV infection affected phenotypic maturation of pDCs from 38 healthy individuals and 28 chronic HBV patients. In addition, we assessed SNP prevalence in a large cohort of healthy individuals (n\,=\,231) and chronic HBV patients (n\,=\,1054). Consistent with previous reports, the rs179008 variant allele was largely absent in Asians and more prevalent in Caucasians. Among Caucasians, the SNP was equally prevalent in healthy and chronically infected males. The SNP was, however, significantly more prevalent in healthy females than in those with chronic HBV infection (42 versus 28\%), suggesting that in females it may offer protection from chronic infection. Ex vivo experiments demonstrated that induction of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 by TLR7 ligands, but not TLR9 ligands, was augmented in pDCs from healthy SNP-carrying females. Furthermore, CD80 and CD86 upregulation was more pronounced in females independent of the SNP. Lastly, our data suggested that chronic HBV infection impairs pDC maturation. These findings provide insight into factors determining TLR7 responses, which is important for further clinical development of TLR7-based therapies.},

Low-dense and medium-rise typologies have been shown to offer good social qualities; their potential energy and carbon advantages have received less attention. As the energy consumption, emissions of cities and heat island effects increase; we question whether dense, high-rise cities offer optimal sustainability. We discuss seven areas where medium density and lower rise typologies offer advantages in terms of energy and climate including: land use/density; microclimate/green space; energy supply; transports; operational energy/carbon; embodied energy/carbon; and resilience.The aim is to discuss the cumulative importance of these areas in the context of sustainable energy use and climate emissions. These areas are subject to ongoing research and are only discussed briefly, since the overarching synthesis perspective for urban planning is our focus. The picture that emerges when these points are seen together, suggests that medium density and lower rise options—like traditional European typologies—may offer, in addition to social qualities, very significant advantages in terms of energy, carbon and climate emissions.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Introduction~ The development of long-acting (LA) drugs has changed the management of common medical conditions for human replication immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Cabenuva (cabotegravir/Rilpivirine) is the first LA antiretroviral injectable drug composed of nano-formulation of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). Areas covered~ In this review article, we aim to have a brief overview of results of major clinical trials that administrated Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine for patients considering the efficacy and safety profiles. Moreover, we discuss about CAB and RPV chemical structure, mechanism of action, ‎activity against drug-sensitive and -resistant HIV, and pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics properties. Expert opinion~ Based on the results of the ATLAS and FLAIR trials, Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine regimen once-monthly has shown equal effectivity to oral combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in maintaining HIV-1 suppression in patients. Furthermore, ATLAS-2~M study revealed the non-inferiority of Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine regimen every 8~weeks compared to every 4~weeks. The injectable LA ART reduces the number of treatment intake as well as increases adherence, especially in patients with HIV-related stigma. Administration of extended-release agents probably minimize the risk of treatment-related toxicity and resistance related to sub-optimal adherence to oral ART, so Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine can be suggested as a suitable alternative for HIV infection control in current era.},

  abstract = {In late 2020, after circulating for almost a year in the human population, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibited a major step change in its adaptation to humans. These highly mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2 had enhanced rates of transmission relative to previous variants and were termed ‘variants of concern’ (VOCs). Designated Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron, the VOCs emerged independently from one another, and in turn each rapidly became dominant, regionally or globally, outcompeting previous variants. The success of each VOC relative to the previously dominant variant was enabled by altered intrinsic functional properties of the virus and, to various degrees, changes to virus antigenicity conferring the ability to evade a primed immune response. The increased virus fitness associated with VOCs is the result of a complex interplay of virus biology in the context of changing human immunity due to both vaccination and prior infection. In this Review, we summarize the literature on the relative transmissibility and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the role of mutations at the furin spike cleavage site and of non-spike proteins, the potential importance of recombination to virus success, and SARS-CoV-2 evolution in the context of T cells, innate immunity and population immunity. SARS-CoV-2 shows a complicated relationship among virus antigenicity, transmission and virulence, which has unpredictable implications for the future trajectory and disease burden of COVID-19., In this Review, the authors summarize the mutations harboured by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern. They describe the impact of mutations on virus infectivity and transmissibility, and discuss SARS-CoV-2 evolution in the context of T cells, innate immunity and population immunity.},

  abstract = {A variety of signals influence the capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) to mount potent antiviral cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses. In particular, innate immune sensing by pathogen recognition receptors, such as TLR and C-type lectines, influences DC biology and affects their susceptibility to HIV infection. Yet, whether the combined effects of PPRs triggering and HIV infection influence HIV-specific (HS) CTL responses remain enigmatic. Here, we dissect the impact of innate immune sensing by pathogen recognition receptors on DC maturation, HIV infection, and on the quality of HS CTL activation. Remarkably, ligand-driven triggering of TLR-3, -4, NOD2, and DC-SIGN, despite reducing viral replication, markedly increased the capacity of infected DCs to stimulate HS CTLs. This was exemplified by the diversity and the quantity of cytokines produced by HS CTLs primed by these DCs. Infecting DCs with viruses harboring members of the APOBEC family of antiviral factors enhanced the antigen-presenting skills of infected DCs. Our results highlight the tight interplay between innate and adaptive immunity and may help develop innovative immunotherapies against viral infections.},

Larger populations have fewer, shorter ROH, whereas isolated or bottlenecked populations have more, somewhat longer ROH. Admixed groups have the fewest ROH, whereas consanguineous communities carry very long ROH. Native American populations have the highest burdens of ROH in the world.ROH can be detected in microarray or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, using either observational approaches, for example, that implemented in PLINK, or model-based approaches. Simulations show that PLINK outperforms many other methods.ROH are non-randomly distributed across the genome, being more prevalent in areas of low recombination, but are also concentrated in small regions called ROH islands.Quantitative traits related to stature and cognition have been robustly associated with ROH burden, implying recessive variants contribute to their genetic architecture. Case–control analyses of ROH, on the other hand, appear more easily confounded by socioeconomic or cultural factors.Both megacohorts and special populations are now being used to investigate diverse aspects of the scope and mechanism of inbreeding depression in humans.},

The chapters show how WHO technical leadership can get multiple partners working together in tandem under coherent strategies. The importance of country leadership and community engagement is stressed repeatedly throughout the chapters. Together we have made tremendous progress. Health and life expectancy have improved nearly everywhere. Millions of lives have been saved. The number of people dying from malaria and HIV has been cut in half. WHO efforts to stop TB saved 49~million lives since the start of this century. In 2015 the number of child deaths dropped below 6~million for the first time a 50\% decrease in annual deaths since 1990. Every day 19 000 fewer children die. We are able to count these numbers because of the culture of measurement and accountability instilled in WHO. These chapters tell a powerful story of global challenges and how they have been overcome. In a world facing considerable uncertainty international health development is a unifying – and uplifting – force for the good of humanity.},

  abstract = {Massive CD4+ T-cell depletion as well as sustained immune activation and inflammation are hallmarks of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 infection. In recent years, an emerging concept draws an intriguing parallel between HIV-1 infection and aging. Indeed, many of the alterations that affect innate and adaptive immune subsets in HIV-infected individuals are reminiscent of the process of immune aging, characteristic of old age. These changes, of which the presumed cause is the systemic immune activation established in patients, likely participate in the immuno-incompetence described with HIV progression. With the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-seropositive patients can now live for many years despite chronic viral infection. However, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related opportunistic infections have given way to chronic diseases as the leading cause of death since HIV infection. Therefore, the comparison between HIV-1 infected patients and uninfected elderly individuals goes beyond the sole onset of immunosenescence and extends to the deterioration of several physiological functions related to inflammation and systemic aging. In light of this observation, it is interesting to understand the precise link between immune activation and aging in HIV-1 infection to figure out how to best care for people living with HIV (PLWH).},

The GG genotype of rs2070788, a higher-expression variant of TMPRSS2, was a risk variant (odds ratio, 2.11; 95\% confidence interval, 1.18-3.77; P = .01) to severe A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza. A potentially functional single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs383510, accommodated in a putative regulatory region was identified to tag rs2070788. Luciferase assay results showed the putative regulatory region was a functional element, in which rs383510 regulated TMPRSS2 expression in a genotype-specific manner. Notably, rs2070788 and rs383510 were significantly associated with the susceptibility to A(H7N9) influenza in 102 patients with A(H7N9) influenza and 106 healthy controls. Therefore, we demonstrate that genetic variants with higher TMPRSS2 expression confer higher risk to severe A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza.

The summed ROHs were used to fit a logistic regression model which noteworthily revealed a significant association between ROHs and the decreased risk of lung cancer (P {$<$} 0.05). We identified 4 common ROHs regions located at 2p22.1, which were significantly associated with decreased risk of lung cancer (P = 2.00 × 10-4 - 1.35 × 10-4). Functional annotation was conducted to investigate the regulatory function of ROHs. The common ROHs were overlapped with potential regulatory elements, such as active epigenome elements and chromatin states in lung-derived cell lines. SOS1 and ARHGEF33 were significantly up-regulated as the putative target genes of the identified ROHs in lung cancer samples according to the analysis of differently expressed genes. Our results suggest that ROHs could act as recessive contributing factors and regulatory elements to influence the risk of lung cancer in never-smoking East Asian females.},

In the present study, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFITM, MBL2, TLR3, TLR8, DDX58, IFIH1, CD55, and FCGR2, genes were investigated in influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus-infected subjects to find out their association with disease severity. Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus-infected subjects with severe disease (n\,=\,86) and mild disease (n\,=\,293) from western India were included in the study. The SNPs were investigated by PCR-based methods. The results revealed a higher frequency of TLR3 rs5743313 T/T genotype [odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.55 (1.08–6.04) p\,=\,0.039] and TLR3 two-locus haplotype rs3775291-rs3775290 T-A [OR with 95\% CI 7.94 (2.05–30.68)] in severe cases. Lower frequency of the mutant allele of MBL2 rs1800450 [OR with 95\% CI 0.51 (0.27–0.87), p\,=\,0.01] and TLR3 two-locus haplotype rs3775291-rs3775290 T-G [OR with 95\% CI 0.48 (0.27–0.85)] was observed in severe cases compared with cases with mild disease. Higher frequency of TLR3 two-locus haplotype rs3775291-rs3775290 T-A was observed in severe cases [OR with 95\% CI 7.9 (2.0–30.7)]. The allele and genotype frequencies of other SNPs were not different between the study categories. The results suggest that the functional SNPs in MBL2 and TLR3 are associated with severe disease in influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus-infected subjects.},

Contributions of ROHs to the genetic architecture of coronary artery disease and regulation of gene expression in cells relevant to atherosclerosis are not known. Our combined analysis of 24,320 individuals from 11 populations of white European ethnicity showed an association between coronary artery disease and both the count and the size of ROHs. Individuals with coronary artery disease had approximately 0.63 (95\% CI: 0.4–0.8) excess of ROHs when compared to coronary-artery-disease-free control subjects (p = 1.49~× 10−9). The average total length of ROHs was approximately 1,046.92 (95\% CI: 634.4–1,459.5) kb greater in individuals with coronary artery disease than control subjects (p = 6.61~× 10−7). None of the identified individual ROHs was associated with coronary artery disease after correction for multiple testing. However, in aggregate burden analysis, ROHs favoring increased risk of coronary artery disease were much more common than those showing the opposite direction of association with coronary artery disease (p = 2.69~× 10−33). Individual ROHs showed significant associations with monocyte and macrophage expression of genes in their close proximity—subjects with several individual ROHs showed significant differences in the expression of 44 mRNAs in monocytes and 17 mRNAs in macrophages when compared to subjects without those ROHs. This study provides evidence for an excess of homozygosity in coronary artery disease in outbred populations and suggest the potential biological relevance of ROHs in cells of importance to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {The global scale-up of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART) has led to dramatic reductions in HIV-1 mortality and incidence. However, HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) poses a potential threat to the long-term success of ART and is emerging as a threat to the elimination of AIDS as a public health problem by 2030. In this review we describe the genetic mechanisms, epidemiology, and management of HIVDR at both individual and population levels across diverse economic and geographic settings. To describe the genetic mechanisms of HIVDR, we review the genetic barriers to resistance for the most commonly used ARVs and describe the extent of cross-resistance between them. To describe the epidemiology of HIVDR, we summarize the prevalence and patterns of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and acquired drug resistance (ADR) in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also review to two categories of HIVDR with important public health relevance: (i) pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR), a World Health Organization-recommended HIVDR surveillance metric and (ii) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-related drug resistance, a type of ADR that can impact clinical outcomes if present at the time of treatment initiation. To summarize the implications of HIVDR for patient management, we review the role of genotypic resistance testing and treatment practices in both high-income and LMIC settings. In high-income countries where drug resistance testing is part of routine care, such an understanding can help clinicians prevent virological failure and accumulation of further HIVDR on an individual level by selecting the most efficacious regimens for their patients. Although there is reduced access to diagnostic testing and to many ARVs in LMIC, understanding the scientific basis and clinical implications of HIVDR is useful in all regions in order to shape appropriate surveillance, inform treatment algorithms, and manage difficult cases.},

To address this, we investigated functionality, clonotypic compartmentalization, spatial localization, phenotypic characteristics, and transcriptional profiles of LN-resident virus-specific CD8+ T cells in persons who control HIV without medications. Antigen-induced proliferative and cytolytic potential consistently distinguished spontaneous controllers from noncontrollers. T cell receptor analysis revealed complete clonotypic overlap between peripheral and LN-resident HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Transcriptional analysis of LN CD8+ T cells revealed gene signatures of inflammatory chemotaxis and antigen-induced effector function. In HIV controllers, the cytotoxic effectors perforin and granzyme B were elevated among virus-specific CXCR5+ fCD8s proximate to foci of HIV RNA within germinal centers. These results provide evidence consistent with cytolytic control of lymphotropic infection supported by inflammatory recruitment, antigen-specific proliferation, and cytotoxicity of fCD8s.},

  abstract = {Despite the overwhelming consensus within the scientific community concerning the causes and effects of climate change, decision-making processes often do not point out in the same direction. In order to effectively and satisfactorily tackle climate change, a legally and politically binding long-term policy architecture is needed. In practice, however, central governments and international policymakers have been unable to provide a successful policy architecture. Yet, city-level initiatives within the Smart City framework are a promising way to tackle climate change. An example of such a Smart City framework is the London Environment Strategy (LES). In this paper, we propose a zero mean reverting model for greenhouse gas emissions to quantitatively analyze its consistency with the 2050 Zero Carbon objectives. We consider different policy scenarios proposed in the LES and the forward-looking policy uncertainty embedded in different economic sectors, primarily domestic, industrial and commercial and transport. We find that, on average, only transport improves the historical greenhouse gas emissions trend, and most of this reduction comes from Smart Mobility and/or Smart Regulation programs focusing on the environment.},

There are key differentiators between Affymetrix' GeneChip technology and other microarray-based methods. The most distinguishing feature of GeneChip microarrays is that their manufacture is directed by photochemical synthesis. Because of this manufacturing technology, more than a million different probes can be synthesized on an array roughly the size of a thumbnail. These numbers allow the inclusion of multiple probes to interrogate the same target sequence, providing statistical rigor to data interpretation. Over the years the GeneChip platform has proven to be a reliable and robust system, enabling many new discoveries and breakthroughs to be made by the scientific community.},

In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, and based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, PUBMED, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases were searched for published studies on ART adherence interventions from 2010 to 2019. Thirty-one eligible studies published between 2010 to 2019 were identified, the categories of interventions were structural, behavioral, biological, cognitive, and combination. Study characteristics varied across design, intervention type, intervention setting, country, and outcome measurements. Many of the studies were behavioral interventions conducted in hospitals with more studies being randomized controlled trial (RCT) interventions. Despite the study variations, twenty-four studies recorded improvements. Notwithstanding, more quality studies such as RCTs should be conducted, especially among key affected populations (KAPs) to control transmission of resistant strains of the virus. Reliable objective measures of adherence should replace the conventional subjective self-report. Furthermore, long-term interventions with longer duration should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.},

HIV can integrate in the host genome and persist for the life span of the infected cell. These latently infected cells are not recognized as foreign because they are largely transcriptionally silent, but contain replication-competent virus that drives resurgence of the infection once ART is stopped. With a combination of immune activators, neutralizing antibodies, and therapeutic vaccines, some nonhuman primate models have been cured, providing optimism for these approaches now being evaluated in human clinical trials. In vivo delivery of gene-editing tools to either target the virus, boost immunity or protect cells from infection, also holds promise for future HIV cure strategies.

  abstract = {The literature around the use, efficacy and design of educational games and game-based learning approaches has been building up gradually and in phases, across different disciplines and in an ad hoc way. This has been problematic in a number of ways and resulted in fragmented literature and inconsistent referencing patterns between different sub-disciplines and countries. This is mainly because no distinct single-disciplinary perspective has emerged because of: the cross-disciplinary nature of educational games, a reliance on single-disciplinary contexts for studies, changing terminologies in different contexts and the use of multi-methodological approaches. Distinct perspectives from education science, game science, neuroscience and information science have deepened our understanding of play and games. This research has become more quantitative, rigorous and nuanced as a result of more studies focused upon therapeutic health applications of games, the serious games research movement and more efficacy and comparative studies that examine and quantify utility.},

Here, we describe an extended genome-wide association meta-analysis of a well-characterized cohort of 3255 COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure and 12\,488 population controls from Italy, Spain, Norway and Germany/Austria, including stratified analyses based on age, sex and disease severity, as well as targeted analyses of chromosome Y haplotypes, the human leukocyte antigen region and the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome. By inversion imputation, we traced a reported association at 17q21.31 to a \textasciitilde 0.9-Mb inversion polymorphism that creates two highly differentiated haplotypes and characterized the potential effects of the inversion in detail. Our data, together with the 5th release of summary statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative including non-Caucasian individuals, also identified a new locus at 19q13.33, including NAPSA, a gene which is expressed primarily in alveolar cells responsible for gas exchange in the lung.},

  abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is now recognized as a chronic illness. Although the success of highly active antiretroviral therapy is beyond question, several issues still persist. Since the drugs cannot eradicate the virus, cure is not yet possible, and patients have to maintain a lifelong adherence with the risk of toxic effects, drug-drug interactions and drug resistance. A clear understanding of the viral replication and its interaction with host cell factors has led to the development of a large number of effective antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). New drugs in the existing class such as apricitabine, elvucitabine and etravirine have shown promising results against HIV isolates resistant to first line drugs. These drugs have offered a new choice for patients with drug resistant disease. However, the impact of their long term use on safety is yet to be assessed. Novel drugs with unique mechanism of action such as CD4 receptor attachment inhibitors, maturation inhibitors, pharmacokinetic enhancers, capsid assembly inhibitors and lens epithelium derived growth factor inhibitors are still under development. Currently, ARVs, especially tenofovir and emtricitabine, are also being evaluated for prevention of sexual transmission of HIV-1. The initial results of an HIV prevention trial network are encouraging and have recommended the use of ARVs for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Thus, ARVs form the key component of HIV prevention and treatment strategy. This article discusses the challenges associated with HIV-1 treatment and updates several major advances in the development of ARVs.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

  abstract = {The relative fitness of HIV-1 viral variants containing a broad range of drug resistance-associated mutations has been little studied in vivo. Understanding the relative fitness associated with viruses containing mutations may aid future therapeutic management. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative fitness of mutant viruses by assessing a cohort of patients who had developed resistance to many drugs and subsequently stopped all therapy. Eleven patients were assessed for drug resistance associated mutations in the protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes before and, at multiple time points, after stopping therapy. Relative fitness was calculated as a function of the rate of disappearance of mutant viruses when therapy was stopped. The least fit viruses were associated with the RT mutation M184I/V (11.6\% less fit) and the PR mutations D30N (12.4\% less fit) and M46I/L (21\% less fit). Mutations at these codons were associated with significant reductions in fitness levels compared to wild-type viruses. Mutations at codons 10, 20, 36, and 63 in the PR gene remained fairly constant when therapy was stopped and may not significantly reduce viral fitness. The rapid re-population of wild-type viruses may allow the recycling of antiretroviral drugs prescribed previously.},

This article presents a study of the published empirical research on the application of gamification to education. The study is limited to papers that discuss explicitly the effects of using game elements in specific educational contexts. It employs a systematic mapping design. Accordingly, a categorical structure for classifying the research results is proposed based on the extracted topics discussed in the reviewed papers. The categories include gamification design principles, game mechanics, context of applying gamification (type of application, educational level, and academic subject), implementation, and evaluation. By mapping the published works to the classification criteria and analyzing them, the study highlights the directions of the currently conducted empirical research on applying gamification to education. It also indicates some major obstacles and needs, such as the need for proper technological support, for controlled studies demonstrating reliable positive or negative results of using specific game elements in particular educational contexts, etc. Although most of the reviewed papers report promising results, more substantial empirical research is needed to determine whether both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of the learners can be influenced by gamification.},

  abstract = {Background HIV-transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is found in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve populations infected with HIV-1 with TDR mutations and is important for guiding future first- and second-line ART regimens. We investigated TDR and its effect on CD4 count in ART-naïve youths from the China-Myanmar border near the Golden Triangle to better understand TDR and effectively guide ART. Methods From 2009 to 2017, 10,832 HIV-1 infected individuals were newly reported along the Dehong border of China, 573 ART-naïve youths (16\,\textasciitilde\,25 y) were enrolled. CD4 counts were obtained from whole blood samples. HIV pol gene sequences were amplified from RNA extracted from plasma. The Stanford REGA program and jpHMM recombination prediction tool were used to determine genotypes. TDR mutations (TDRMs) were analyzed using the Stanford Calibrated Population Resistance tool. Results The most common infection route was heterosexuals (70.51\%), followed by people who inject drugs (PWID, 19.20\%) and men who have sex with men (MSM) (8.90\%). The distribution of HIV genotypes mainly included the unique recombinant form (URF) (44.08\%), 38.68\% were CRFs, 13.24\% were subtype C and 4.04\% were subtype B. The prevalence of TDR increased significantly from 2009 to 2017 (3.48 to 9.48\%) in ART-naïve youths (4.00 to 13.16\% in Burmese subjects, 3.33 to 5.93\% in Chinese subjects), and the resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs) were 3.49, 2.62, and 0.52\%, respectively. Most (94.40\%, n\,=\,34) of HIV-1-infected patients with TDRM had mutation that conferred resistance to a single drug class. The most common mutations Y181I/C and K103N, were found in 7 and 9 youths, respectively. The mean CD4 count was significantly lower among individuals with TDRMs (373/mm3 vs. 496/mm3, p\,=\,0.013). Conclusions The increase in the prevalence of HIV-1 TDR increase and a low CD4 count of patients with TDRMs in the China-Myanmar border suggests the need for considering drug resistance before initiating ART in HIV recombination hotspots.

  abstract = {Traffic has a direct impact on local and regional economies, on pollution levels and is also a major source of discomfort and frustration for the public who have to deal with congestion, accidents or detours due to road works or accidents. Congestion in urban areas is a common phenomenon nowadays, as the main arteries of cities become congested during peak hours or when there are additional constraints such as traffic accidents and road works that slow down traffic on road sections. When traffic increases, it is observed that some roads are predisposed to congestion, while others are not. It is evident that both congestion and urban traffic itself are influenced by several factors represented by complex geospatial data and the spatial relationships between them. In this paper were integrated mathematical models, real time traffic data with network analysis and simulation procedures in order to analyze the public transportation in Oradea and the impact on urban traffic. A mathematical model was also adapted to simulate the travel choices of the population of the city and of the surrounding villages. Based on the network analysis, traffic analysis and on the traveling simulation, the elements generating traffic congestion in the inner city can be easily determined. The results of the case study are emphasizing that diminishing the traffic and its effects can be obtained by improving either the public transport density or its accessibility.},

We demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and jointly analyze experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are encountered in making gene-to-transcript–to-protein mappings. The approach provides a flexible, programmable and reproducible basis for state-of-the-art bioinformatic data integration.},

  abstract = {Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the commonest post-infectious polyradiculopathy. Although genetic background of the host seems to play an important role in the susceptibility to GBS, genes conferring major risk are not yet known. Dysregulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) molecules exacerbates immune-inflammatory responses and the genetic variations within TLR pathway-related genes contribute to differential risk to infection. The aim of this study was to delineate the impact of genetic variations within TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 genes as well as TLR signaling pathway-related genes such as MyD88, TRIF, TRAF3, TRAF6, IRF3, NFκβ1, and IκBα on risk of developing GBS. Fourteen polymorphisms located within TLR2 (rs3804099, rs111200466), TLR3 (rs3775290, rs3775291), TLR4 (rs1927911, rs11536891), MyD88 (rs7744, rs4988453), TRIF (rs8120), TRAF3 (rs12147254), TRAF6 (rs4755453), IRF3 (rs2304204), NFκβ1 (rs28362491), and IκBα (rs696) genes were genotyped in 150 GBS patients and 150 healthy subjects either by PCR-RFLP or TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay. Genotypes of two polymorphic variants, Del/Del of rs111200466 insertion and deletion (INDEL) polymorphism of TLR2 gene and TT of rs3775290 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of TLR3 gene had significantly higher frequencies among GBS patients, while the frequencies of TT genotype of rs3804099 SNP of TLR2 gene and TT genotype of rs11536891 SNP of TLR4 gene were significantly higher in controls. Gene-gene interaction study by Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction analysis also suggested a significant combined effect of TLR2, and NFκβ1 genes on the risk of GBS. The SNPs in the IκBα and IRF3 genes correlated with severity of GBS. The genes encoding TLRs and TLR signaling pathway-related molecules could serve as crucial genetic markers of susceptibility and severity of GBS.},

Improving our knowledge of cities and settlements by measuring their size extent, as well as the societal processes occurring within settlements, is key to understanding their impact on the local, regional and global environment for addressing global sustainability and the integrity of planet Earth. The reviewed papers are grouped around five main topics: Quantifying human presence; assessing settlement growth over time; estimating societal impact, assessing natural hazard risk and impact, and generating indicators for international framework agreements and policy documents. This review calls for continuing to refine and expand the work on societal variables that, when combined with essential variables including those for climate, biodiversity and ocean, can improve our understanding of the societal impact on the biosphere and help to monitor progress towards local, regional and planetary sustainability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are linked with functional modification of cytokine responses. In chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, studies of TLR polymorphisms have primarily targeted receptor pathways implicated in viral immune responses. We hypothesized that one or more variant(s) of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8 are associated with different outcomes of HCV infection. MATERIALS \& METHODS: A total of 3368 subjects from 850 families were recruited and divided into three main groups categorized as chronic HCV CHC spontaneous viral clearance (SVC), and controls. All individuals were genotyped for three SNPs for TLR3, two SNPs for TLR7, and two SNPs for TLR8 using allelic discrimination real-time PCR. RESULTS: Carriage of the C allele in three SNPs of TLR3 (rs3775290, rs3775291, and rs5743312), the C allele in TLR7 (rs3853839) in females only, and the C allele in TLR8 (rs3764879) in males only were significantly higher in SVC group than CHC group (P {$<$} 0.001), while carriage of the T allele in TLR7 (rs179008) in females only and the A allele in TLR8 (rs3764880) in both males and females were significantly higher in CHC infection more than SVC group (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: The C allele is protective of HCV in TLR3, TLR7 (rs3853839) in females only, and TLR8 (rs3764879) in males only, while risk of infection is linked to the T allele in TLR7 (rs179008) in females only and the A allele in TLR8 (rs3764880) in both sexes.},

  abstract = {The influence of intracellular Toll-like-receptors (TLR), recognized as nucleic acid sensors, in the immunopathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is increasingly explored. Yet, the results of both functional and genetic studies remain conflictual. We evaluated the association between TLR3 and TLR7 genes selected variants and SLE and investigated the possible relationship with clinical and serological parameters. Then, we studied the genetic expression of these receptors, and if the TLR7 gene evades X chromosome inactivation (XCI). Our study covers 106 cases and 200 controls, genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. TLR3 and TLR7 expression level was assessed by qPCR carried, respectively, on renal tissues and PBMC, and methylation status was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR. Results were statistically analysed using Shesis software, χ2, and Mann–Whitney test. Significant associations with SLE susceptibility were found for the TLR3 rs3775291, rs5743305 and rs3775294 polymorphisms. Further subgroup analysis, TLR3 rs3775291 and rs3775294 polymorphisms were significantly associated with lupus nephritis (LN) and even correlate with the presence of auto-antibodies binding RNA molecules. SLE and LN were more common in men with rs3853839-G variant within TLR7 gene versus those carrying the C allele. Moreover, the role of the G allele in the TLR7 expression up-regulation was confirmed. However, gene expression analysis showed no significant differences in TLR3 and TLR7 mRNA levels between LN patient biopsies and healthy tissues (p {$>$} .05). When comparing patients and controls, no statistical difference was observed in XCI pattern. Otherwise, notable associations were raised between TLR3 and TLR7 gene variants and clinical and serological lupus features pointing towards the role of genetic background in the physiopathogenesis of the disease.},

  abstract = {The recent pandemic which arose from China, is caused by a pathogenic virus named "severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)". Its rapid global expansion has inflicted an extreme public health concern. The attachment of receptor-binding domains (RBD) of the spike proteins (S) to the host cell's membrane, with or without the help of other cellular components such as proteases and especially co-receptors, is required for the first stage of its pathogenesis. In addition to humans, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is found on a wide range of vertebrate host's cellular surface. SARS-CoV-2 has a broad spectrum of tropism; thus, it can infect a vast range of tissues, organs, and hosts; even though the surface amino acids of the spike protein conflict in the receptor-binding region. Due to the heterogeneous ACE2 distribution and the presence of different domains on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for binding, the virus entry into diverse host cell types may depend on the host cells' receptor presentation with or without co-receptors. This review investigates multiple current types of receptor and co-receptor tropisms, with other molecular factors alongside their respective mechanisms, which facilitate the binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells, extending the severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 from this perspective can effectively help prevent this disease and provide more potent treatment strategies, particularly in vulnerable people with various cellular-level susceptibilities.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims The natural outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well as the progression of the liver disease are highly variable and depend primarily on an efficient immune response. As toll-like receptors seven (TLR7) and eight (TLR8) are important effectors of the innate immunity, this study aims to evaluate the association between TLR7 and TLR8 polymorphisms and the HCV infection outcomes in Moroccan subjects. Methods In this case–control study, 643 subjects including 293 mild chronic hepatitis patients, 119 with advanced liver disease (AdLD), 93 with HCV spontaneous clearance and 138 healthy controls were genotyped using TaqMan SNPs assays. Results Patients carrying TLR7 rs179008-A allele were more likely to clear the virus spontaneously (P = .0001 for women, and P {$<$} .001 for men). Besides, carriage of TLR7 rs179009-A allele was associated with a twofold increase in spontaneous viral clearance in female patients (P = .0002), but not in men. In addition, we observed that TLR7 rs179008-T and rs179009-G alleles increased the risk of disease progression in both sexes (P {$<$} .05). TLR8 rs3764880-G allele was associated with spontaneous HCV clearance in both sexes (P {$<$} .0001) albeit with an apparently stronger association in males (OR = 6.02 for men vs 2.2 for women). In males, TLR8 rs3764879-C and TLR8 rs3764880-A alleles were significantly associated with AdLD status (P {$<$} .05). Conclusions Our results suggest that variations in TLR7 and TLR8 genes modulate the clearance and progression of HCV infection with different magnitudes between sexes. Our results refine, therefore, our understanding of the sex-specific differences observed regarding the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis.},

  abstract = {The global evolution of SARS-CoV-2 depends in part upon the evolutionary dynamics within individual hosts with varying immune histories. To characterize the within-host evolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, we deep sequenced saliva and nasal samples collected daily from immune and unvaccinated individuals early during infection. We show that longitudinal sampling facilitates high-confidence genetic variant detection and reveals evolutionary dynamics missed by less-frequent sampling strategies. Within-host dynamics in both naïve and immune individuals appeared largely stochastic; however, we identified clear mutational hotspots within the viral genome, consistent with selection and differing between naïve and immune individuals. In rare cases, minor genetic variants emerged to frequencies sufficient for forward transmission. Finally, we detected significant genetic compartmentalization of virus between saliva and nasal swab sample sites in many individuals. Altogether, these data provide a high-resolution profile of within-host SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics.},

HIV-1 has a variety of novel genes that facilitate viral persistence and regulation of HIV replication, but this virus also usurps cellular machinery for HIV replication, particularly during gene expression and virion assembly and budding. Recent success with antiretroviral therapy may be limited by the emergence HIV drug resistance and by toxicities and other requirements for successful long-term therapy. Further investigation of HIV-1 replication may allow identification of novel targets of antiretroviral therapy that may allow continued virus suppression in patients of failing current regiments, particularly drugs that target HIV-1 entry and HIV-1 integration.},

The host protease TMPRSS2 was required for infection of these cells. Importantly, remdesivir treatment effectively inhibited viral replication across cell types, and blunted hyperinflammatory responses. Induction of interferon responses within infected cells was rare and there was significant heterogeneity in the antiviral gene signatures, varying with the burden of infection in each cell. We also found that heavily infected secretory cells expressed abundant IL-6, a potential mediator of COVID-19 pathogenesis.},

The subjects were stratified according to numbers of T cells with CD4 surface markers and were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg of AZT or placebo by mouth every four hours for a total of 24 weeks. One hundred forty-five subjects received AZT, and 137 received placebo. When the study was terminated, 27 subjects had completed 24 weeks of the study, 152 had completed 16 weeks, and the remainder had completed at least 8 weeks. Nineteen placebo recipients and 1 AZT recipient died during the study (P less than 0.001). Opportunistic infections developed in 45 subjects receiving placebo, as compared with 24 receiving AZT. The base-line Karnofsky performance score and weight increased significantly among AZT recipients (P less than 0.001). A statistically significant increase in the number of CD4 cells was noted in subjects receiving AZT (P less than 0.001). After 12 weeks, the number of CD4 cells declined to pretreatment values among AZT recipients with AIDS but not amonG AZT recipients with AIDS-related complex. Skin-test anergy was partially reversed in 29 percent of subjects receiving AZT, as compared with 9 percent of those receiving placebo (P less than 0.001). These data demonstrate that AZT administration can decrease mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in a selected group of subjects with AIDS or AIDS-related complex, at least over the 8 to 24 weeks of observation in this study.},

  abstract = {Highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), usually consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) plus an HIV protease inhibitor (PI), have been widely used since 1996. They produce durable suppression of viral replication with undetectable plasma levels of HIV-RNA in more than half of patients. Immunity recovers, and morbidity and mortality fall by more than 80\% [1, 2]. Treatment was thought to be particularly effective when started early; therefore, HAART was recommended for essentially all HIV-infected persons willing to commit themselves to lifelong therapy [3, 4]. Besides these successes, however, HAART also produces problems. HIV is not eradicated by present-day drugs, and patients often cannot comply with long-term combination treatment [5, 6]. Moreover, HAART causes unexpected and ill-understood side effects [7]. The dogma of earliest possible treatment has therefore come under attack. Ten principles governing anti-retroviral treatment are summarised in Table 1. Starting and maintaining HAART is complex. Within the last few years, the numbers of antiretrovirals, their known and potential interactions with each other and with non-HIV drugs, and the list of their side effects have all increased exponentially. As a rule a physician specialising in HIV care should be consulted whenever HAART is started or changed. It is his task to ensure that the treatment chosen is optimal for the particular patient.},

Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of mode choice and their effects over time is important. This study sought to understand how accessibility to employment by public transit changes over time, and how this accessibility explains changes in transit use. With the use of linear regression analysis, the authors explored the influence of job accessibility, transport infrastructure, and social disadvantage on transit mode share for three job categories in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 2 years, 1996 and 2006. New transit infrastructure did not necessarily attract more transit commuters but was found to affect commuting to different job categories differently. Also, new highway infrastructure hampered transit mode share, regardless of job type. The aggregate all-jobs model was found to dilute some differences between the transit mode choices of people commuting to different job categories. Finally, increases in accessibility by transit were found to augment transit mode share, while people in more socially disadvantaged areas were more likely to commute by transit in any job category. This study reveals findings that may be of interest to land use and transportation planners working toward boosting regional transit ridership, while also attaining social equity goals.},

  abstract = {Background There is indirect evidence that HIV-1 exposure does not inevitably lead to persistent infection. Heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection could be due to protective immunity. The objective of this study was to find out whether in highly HIV-1–exposed populations some individuals are resistant to infection. Methods We did an observational cohort study of incident HIV-1 infection among 424 initially HIV-1–seronegative prostitutes in Nairobi, Kenya, between 1985 and 1994. 239 women seroconverted to HIV-1 during the study period. Exponential, Weibull, and mixture survival models were used to examine the effect of the duration of follow-up on incidence of HIV-1 infection. The influence of the duration of exposure to HIV-1 through prostitution on seroconversion risk was examined by Cox proportional hazards modelling, with control for other known or suspected risk factors for incident HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 PCR with env, nef, and vif gene primers was done on 43 persistently seronegative prostitutes who remained seronegative after 3 or more years of follow-up. Findings Modelling of the time to HIV-1 seroconversion showed that the incidence of HIV-1 seroconversion decreased with increasing duration of exposure, which indicates that there is heterogeneity in HIV-1 susceptibility or acquired immunity to HIV-1. Each weighted year of exposure through prostitution resulted in a 12–fold reduction in HIV-1 seroconversion risk (hazard ratio 0·83 [95\% CI 0·79–0·88], p{$<$}0·0001). Analyses of epidemiological and laboratory data, show that persistent seronegativity is not explained by seronegative HIV-1 infection or by differences in risk factors for HIV-1 infection such as safer sexual behaviours or the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections. Interpretation We conclude that a small proportion of highly exposed individuals, who may have natural protective immunity to HIV-1, are resistant to HIV-1.},

  abstract = {The host innate immune response is an important deterrent of severe viral infection in humans and animals. Nuclear import factors function as key gatekeepers that regulate the transport of innate immune regulatory cargo to the nucleus of cells to activate the antiviral response. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model, we demonstrate that SARS-COV ORF6 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi membrane in infected cells, where it binds to and disrupts nuclear import complex formation by tethering karyopherin alpha 2 and karyopherin beta 1 to the membrane. Retention of import factors at the ER/Golgi membrane leads to a loss of STAT1 transport into the nucleus in response to interferon signaling, thus blocking the expression of STAT1-activated genes that establish an antiviral state. We mapped the region of ORF6, which binds karyopherin alpha 2, to the C terminus of ORF6 and show that mutations in the C terminus no longer bind karyopherin alpha 2 or block the nuclear import of STAT1. We also show that N-terminal deletions of karyopherin alpha 2 that no longer bind to karyopherin beta 1 still retain ORF6 binding activity but no longer block STAT1 nuclear import. Recombinant SARS-CoV lacking ORF6 did not tether karyopherin alpha 2 to the ER/Golgi membrane and allowed the import of the STAT1 complex into the nucleus. We discuss the likely implications of these data on SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis.},

Contemporary molecular techniques, however, offer the promise of improved tumor classification and resultant patient stratification for treatment and prognosis. In particular, gene expression profiling has shown exceptional promise for providing an alternative and more objective molecular approach to glioma classification. In this study, we used cDNA array technology to profile the gene expression of 30 primary human glioma tissue samples comprising 4 different glioma subtypes as defined by current World Health Organization (WHO 2000) criteria: glioblastoma (GM, WHO grade IV), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA, WHO grade III), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO, WHO grade III), and oligodendroglioma (OL, WHO grade II). Gene expression data alone were used to group the tumors using multidimensional scaling, which is an unsupervised statistical method. Results show that impressive separation of the 4 glioma subtypes can be achieved solely on the basis of molecular data. In addition, a subcluster of 3 glioblastomas was identified as distinct from other GMs and from the oligodendroglial tumors. These 3 patients have shown extended survival compared to other GMs in the study. Survival analysis of the full data set revealed a good correlation with the molecular classification. Results of this proof-of-principle study demonstrate that molecular profiling alone can recapitulate conventional histologic classification and grading with high fidelity. In addition, results show that the molecular approach to tumor classification can generate clinically meaningful patient stratification, and, more importantly, is an efficient class-discovery tool for human gliomas, permitting the identification of previously unrecognized, clinically relevant tumor subsets.},

This study aimed to describe viral quasispecies population of upper and lower respiratory tract by next-generation sequencing in patients admitted to intensive care unit. A deep sequencing of the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 from 109 clinical specimens, sampled from the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) of 77 patients was performed. A higher incidence of non-synonymous mutations and indels was observed in the LRT among minority variants. This might be explained by the ability of the virus to invade cells without interacting with ACE2 (e.g. exploiting macrophage phagocytosis). Minority variants are highly concentrated around the gene portion encoding for the Spike cleavage site, with a higher incidence in the URT; four mutations are highly recurring among samples and were found associated with the URT. Interestingly, 55.8\% of minority variants detected in this locus were T{$>$}G and G{$>$}T transversions. Results from this study evidenced the presence of selective pressure and suggest that an evolutionary process is still ongoing in one of the crucial sites of spike protein associated with the spillover to humans.},

  abstract = {This natural field experiment tests the effects of purely symbolic awards on volunteer retention in a public goods context. The experiment is conducted at Wikipedia, which faces declining editor retention rates, particularly among newcomers. Randomization assures that award receipt is orthogonal to previous performance. The analysis reveals that awards have a sizeable effect on newcomer retention, which persists over the four quarters following the initial intervention. This is noteworthy for indicating that awards for volunteers can be effective even if they have no impact on the volunteers’ future career opportunities. The awards are purely symbolic, and the status increment they produce is limited to the recipients’ pseudonymous online identities in a community they have just recently joined. The results can be explained by enhanced self-identification with the community, but they are also in line with recent findings on the role of status and reputation, recognition, and evaluation potential in online communities. Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2540. This paper was accepted by John List, behavioral economics.},

  abstract = {New SARS-CoV-2 mutants have been continuously indentified with enhanced transmission ever since its outbreak in early 2020. As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has a high mutation rate due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerase. To study the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, 158 SNPs with high confidence were identified by deep meta-transcriptomic sequencing, and the most common SNP type was C {$>~$}T. Analyses of intra-host population diversity revealed that intra-host quasispecies’ composition varies with time during the early onset of symptoms, which implicates viral evolution during infection. Network analysis of co-occurring SNPs revealed the most abundant non-synonymous SNP 22,638 in the S glycoprotein RBD region and 28,144 in the ORF8 region. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 variations differ in an individual’s respiratory tissue (nose, throat, BALF, or sputum), suggesting independent compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 populations in patients. The positive selection analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome uncovered the positive selected amino acid G251V on ORF3a. Alternative allele frequency spectrum (AAFS) of all variants revealed that ORF8 could bear alternate alleles with high frequency. Overall, the results show the quasispecies’ profile of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract in the first two months after the outbreak.},

In addition to numerous mutations that map in the spike protein of VOCs, expression of the viral accessory proteins ORF6 and ORF9b also elevate; both are potent interferon antagonists. Here, we present the crystal structures of Rae1-Nup98 in complex with the C-terminal tails (CTT) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV ORF6 to 2.85\,Å and 2.39\,Å resolution, respectively. An invariant methionine (M) 58 residue of ORF6 CTT extends its side chain into a hydrophobic cavity in the Rae1 mRNA binding groove, resembling a bolt-fitting-hole; acidic residues flanking M58 form salt-bridges with Rae1. Our mutagenesis studies identify key residues of ORF6 important for its interaction with Rae1-Nup98 in vitro and in cells, of which M58 is irreplaceable. Furthermore, we show that ORF6-mediated blockade of mRNA and STAT1 nucleocytoplasmic transport correlate with the binding affinity between ORF6 and Rae1-Nup98. Finally, binding of ORF6 to Rae1-Nup98 is linked to ORF6-induced interferon antagonism. Taken together, this study reveals the molecular basis for the antagonistic function of Sarbecovirus ORF6, and implies a strategy of using ORF6 CTT-derived peptides for immunosuppressive drug development.},

  abstract = {Background Hypercytokinemia is the main immunopathological mechanism contributing to a more severe clinical course in influenza A (H1N1) virus infections. Most patients infected with the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus had increased systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines; including interleukin IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). We propose that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of pro-inflammatory genes are associated with the severity of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus infection. Methods 145 patients with influenza A (H1N1) (pA/H1N1), 133 patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), and 360 asymptomatic healthy contacts (AHCs) were included. Eleven SNPs were genotyped in six genes (TNF, LT, IL1B, IL6, CCL1, and IL8) using real-time PCR; the ancestral genotype was used for comparison. Genotypes were correlated with 27 clinical severity variables. Ten cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-5, and IL-4) were measured on a Luminex 100. Results The IL6 rs1818879 (GA) heterozygous genotype was associated with severe influenza A (H1N1) virus infection (odds ratio [OR] = 5.94, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 3.05–11.56), and two IL1B SNPs, rs16944 AG and rs3136558 TC, were associated with a decreased risk of infection (OR = 0.52 and OR = 0.51, respectively). Genetic susceptibility was determined (pA/H1N1 vs. AHC): the LTA rs909253 TC heterozygous genotype conferred greater risk (OR = 1.9), and a similar association was observed with the IL1B rs3136558 CC genotype (OR = 1.89). Additionally, severely ill patients were compared with moderately ill patients. The TNF-238 GA genotype was associated with an increased risk of disease severity (OR = 16.06, p = 0.007). Compared with ILIs, patients with severe pA/H1N1 infections exhibited increased serum IL-5 (p {$<$}0.001) and IL-6 (p = 0.007) levels. Conclusions The TNF gene was associated with disease severity, whereas IL1B and IL6 SNPs were associated with influenza A (H1N1) virus infection.},

  abstract = {In early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the virus population escapes from multiple CD8+ cell responses. The later an escape mutation emerges, the slower it outgrows its competition, i.e., the escape rate is lower. This pattern could indicate that the strength of the CD8+ cell responses is waning, or that later viral escape mutants carry a larger fitness cost. In this paper, we investigate whether the pattern of decreasing escape rates could also be caused by genetic interference among different escape strains. To this end, we developed a mathematical multi-epitope model of HIV dynamics, which incorporates stochastic effects, recombination, and mutation. We used cumulative linkage disequilibrium measures to quantify the amount of interference. We found that nearly synchronous, similarly strong immune responses in two-locus systems enhance the generation of genetic interference. This effect, combined with a scheme of densely spaced sampling times at the beginning of infection and sparse sampling times later, leads to decreasing successive escape rate estimates, even when there were no selection differences among alleles. These predictions are supported by empirical data from one HIV-infected patient. Thus, interference could explain why later escapes are slower. Considering escape mutations in isolation, neglecting their genetic linkage, conceals the underlying haplotype dynamics and can affect the estimation of the selective pressure exerted by CD8+ cells. In systems in which multiple escape mutations appear, the occurrence of interference dynamics should be assessed by measuring the linkage between different escape mutations.},

They offer higher throughput than standard animal models while more accurately mimicking the native tissue of infection than transformed cell lines. Here, we review recent literature that highlights virological advances facilitated by HIOs. We discuss the variations and limitations of HIOs, how HIOs have allowed for the cultivation of previously uncultivatable viruses, and how they have offered insight into tropism, entry, replication kinetics, and host-pathogen interactions. In each case, we discuss exemplary viruses and archetypal studies. We discuss how the speed and flexibility of HIO-based studies contributed to our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and antiviral therapeutics.

These subjects are referred to as HIV-1–exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals and include people located in different areas, with diverse ethnic backgrounds and routes of exposure. The mechanism/s responsible for protection from infection in HESN individuals are basically indefinite and most likely are multifactorial.Areas covered: Host factors, including genetic background as well as natural and acquired immunity, have all been associated with this phenomenon. Recently, epigenetic factors have been investigated as possible determinants of reduced susceptibility to HIV~infection. With the advent of the OMICS era, the availability of techniques such as GWAS, RNAseq, and exome-sequencing in both bulk cell populations and single cells will likely lead to great strides in the understanding of the HESN mystery.Expert opinion: The employment of increasingly sophisticated techniques is allowing the gathering of enormous amounts of data. The integration of such information will provide important hints that could lead to the identification of viral and host correlates of protection against HIV infection, allowing the development of more effective preventative and therapeutic regimens.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: More severe cases of COVID- 19 are more likely to be hospitalized and around one-fifth, needing ICU admission. Understanding the common laboratory features of COVID-19 in more severe cases versus non-severe patients could be quite useful for clinicians and might help to predict the model of disease progression. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the laboratory test findings in severe vs. non-severe confirmed infected cases of COVID-19. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from the beginning of 2019 to 3rd of March 2020. Heterogeneity across included studies was determined using Cochrane's Q test and the I2 statistic. We used the fixed or random-effect models to pool the weighted mean differences (WMDs) or standardized mean differences and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). FINDINGS: Out of a total of 3009 citations, 17 articles (22 studies, 21 from China and one study from Singapore) with 3396 ranging from 12 to1099 patients were included. Our meta-analyses showed a significant decrease in lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil, hemoglobin, platelet, albumin, serum sodium, lymphocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LCR), leukocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LeCR), leukocyte to IL-6 ratio (LeIR), and an increase in the neutrophil, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), D-dimer, glucose level, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the severe group compared with the non-severe group. No significant changes in white blood cells (WBC), Creatine Kinase (CK), troponin I, myoglobin, IL-6 and K between the two groups were observed. INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis provides evidence for the differentiation of severe cases of COVID-19 based on laboratory test results at the time of ICU admission. Future well-methodologically designed studies from other populations are strongly recommended.},

  abstract = {The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 2.3 million people, killed over 160,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption,. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy, nor are there vaccines for its prevention, and these efforts are hampered by limited knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), identifying 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds). Screening a subset of these in multiple viral assays identified two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors. Further studies of these host factor targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.},

  abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in late 2021 and is characterised by multiple spike mutations across all spike domains. Here we show that Omicron BA.1 has higher affinity for ACE2 compared to Delta, and confers very significant evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralising antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralisation. Importantly, antiviral drugs remdesevir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. We found that in human nasal epithelial 3D cultures replication was similar for both Omicron and Delta. However, in lower airway organoids, Calu-3 lung cells and gut adenocarcinoma cell lines live Omicron virus demonstrated significantly lower replication in comparison to Delta. We noted that despite presence of mutations predicted to favour spike S1/S2 cleavage, the spike protein is less efficiently cleaved in live Omicron virions compared to Delta virions. We mapped the replication differences between the variants to entry efficiency using spike pseudotyped virus (PV) entry assays. The defect for Omicron PV in specific cell types correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2, and accordingly knock down of TMPRSS2 impacted Delta entry to a greater extent as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently utilises the cellular protease TMPRSS2 that mediates cell entry via plasma membrane fusion. Instead, we demonstrate that Omicron spike has greater dependency on cell entry via the endocytic pathway requiring the activity of endosomal cathepsins to cleave spike. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to utilise TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was dramatically impaired compared to the Delta spike. Overall, Omicron appears to have gained significant evasion from neutralising antibodies whilst maintaining sensitivity to antiviral drugs targeting the polymerase. Omicron has shifted cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2 expressing cells that are enriched in cells found in the lower respiratory and GI tracts, with implications for altered pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Host cellular receptors play key roles in the determination of virus tropism and pathogenesis. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 host receptors with the exception of ACE2. Furthermore, ACE2 alone cannot explain the multi-organ tropism of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting the involvement of other receptor(s). Here, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen 5054 human membrane proteins individually for interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein. Twelve proteins, including ACE2, ASGR1, and KREMEN1, were identified with diverse S-binding affinities and patterns. ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes distinct ACE2/ASGR1/KREMEN1 (ASK) receptor combinations to enter different cell types, and the expression of ASK together displays a markedly stronger correlation with virus susceptibility than that of any individual receptor at both the cell and tissue levels. The cocktail of ASK-related neutralizing antibodies provides the most substantial blockage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids when compared to individual antibodies. Our study revealed an interacting host receptome of SARS-CoV-2, and identified ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as alternative functional receptors that play essential roles in ACE2-independent virus entry, providing insight into SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathogenesis, as well as a community resource and potential therapeutic strategies for further COVID-19 investigations.},

  abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) give the innate immune system a considerable specificity for a large range of pathogens. TLR3 detects dsRNA of viruses while TLR9 recognizes bacterial and viral unmethylated CpG motifs. This study examined whether there is a potential association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR3.rs3775290 (c.1377C/T), TLR9.rs5743836 (-1237T→C) and TLR9.rs352140 (G2848A) genes and HCV infection among Egyptian patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). We enrolled 546 subjects (409 HCWs and 137 patients) divided into four groups: group 1 included 265 seronegative, aviremic subjects; group 2 included 25 seronegative, viremic subjects; group 3 included 87 subjects with spontaneously resolved HCV infection; and group 4 included 169 chronic HCV patients. All subjects were genotyped for TLR3.rs3775290, TLR9.rs5743836 and TLR9.rs352140 SNPs by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. TLR3.rs3775290 “CC” genotype was associated with chronic HCV infection, where there was a significantly greater frequency of this genotype among chronic patients when compared to subjects with spontaneously resolved infection (63.9\% vs. 51.9\%; p\,=\,0.033; OR\,=\,1.639 and 95\% CI\,=\,0.94-2.84). However, this SNP did not correlate with the HCV RNA load among the chronic subjects (p\,{$>$}\,0.05). There was no significant difference in TLR9.rs5743836 and TLR9.rs352140 genotype distribution between groups (p\,{$>$}\,0.05). Lack of association between the three SNPs was found, as the three SNPs are located on two different chromosomes. In conclusion, the TLR3.rs3775290 “CC” genotype was associated with HCV chronicity, while the TLR9 gene may not play a major role in HCV infection.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the crosstalk between TLR and Notch in inflammatory regulation in EV71 infection. Thirty-seven EV-71-indcued HFMD (16 mild and 21 severe cases) and eleven normal control (NC) were enrolled. CD14+ monocytes were purified, and were stimulated with either TLR3/4 agonists [poly(I: C) or LPS] or Notch signaling inhibitor. TLRs and Notch receptors expression, proinflammatory cytokines production, and important molecules in signaling pathways were measured by real-time PCR, ELISA, and Western blot. TLR3 and TLR4 was significantly elevated in CD14+ monocytes from HFMD patients than NC. Notch1 and Notch2 mRNA was also remarkably increased in CD14+ monocytes from severe HFMD. Poly(I: C) stimulation resulted in robust increase of IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-α by CD14+ monocytes in severe HFMD compared to NC. Activation of Notch1, Notch2, and target genes, Hes1 and Hes5 was also enhanced upon ploy(I: C) treatment. Although inhibition of Notch signaling did not affect TLR3 expression, poly(I: C)-induced inflammatory response was robustly attenuated, which was accompanied by silencing Src phosphorylation in CD14+ monocytes from severe HFMD patients. The current data indicated that crosstalk between TLR3 and Notch signaling modulated CD14+ monocytes function and inflammatory responses in the progression of EV71-induced HFMD.},

  abstract = {Newly synthesized mammalian secretory proteins such as preprolactin are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent manner. Recent studies revealed that there are two recognition steps for signal peptides during this translocation. The first step is recognition by SRP, which results in elongation arrest, and the second step is interaction between signal peptides and the translocation channel embedded in the ER membrane. To determine the roles of the hydrophobic region of signal peptides in the recognition by SRP and the membrane-embedded translocation machinery, we constructed chimeric proteins consisting of the mature region of preprolactin and signal peptides containing different numbers of leucine residues. The translocation of these chimeric proteins was completely dependent on SRP, and the efficiency increased as the number of leucine residues increased up to 10 and then decreased. Although the efficiency of elongation arrest also increased as the number of leucine residues increased up to 10, it only slightly decreased as the number increased up to 20. Similar results were obtained when the hydrophobic region was replaced by alternate leucine and alanine residues, except that the most efficient translocation occurred when the number was 14. Taken together, the present results suggest that the total hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic region of signal peptides is a determinant for recognition by both SRP and the membrane-embedded translocation machinery, although the specificities of the two signal recognition steps are slightly different from each other.}

  abstract = {This study analyses the influence of Personalized Conditioning (PC) systems for potential savings of energy, cost, and CO2 emissions from commercial buildings in different U.S. cities. This analysis characterizes potential benefits from the deployment of PC systems during peak cooling hours for peak load shifting. PC systems deployed in coordination with the central building air conditioning systems could have a large-scale influence on a city's energy footprint. Specifically, portable PC systems that use Phase Change Materials (PCMs) for heat rejection, allow for heat absorption during the working hours and heat rejection during non-working hours typically coinciding with the off-peak (base) utility rates when the commercial building tend to be unoccupied. However, there are limiting factors for the potential energy and cost savings with the use of PC systems. Therefore, this study assesses the use of PC systems in addition to the existing building air conditioning system during cooling seasons. The assessment entails potential energy end-use savings for 7 major cities located in different geographical/climatic regions of the U.S. Furthermore, the study calculates potential cost savings based on the variations in the peak and off-peak (base) electricity rates for different local Time of Use (TOU) programs. This simulated evaluation of local building systems and utility programs allows for regional various on the city's energy footprint reduction to emerge. The analysis shows that midrise apartments are a better building type than office buildings for the deployment of PC systems during a cooling season. The cash savings per person for the deployment of PC systems for midrise apartments are \$62/year, \$40/year, and \$37/year for Honolulu, NY City, and Phoenix, respectively. The simulations also showed that using extended setpoint temperatures could reduce the CO2 emissions up to 21.4\% per year.},

Cross-validation of gene expression patterns in organoids reflects proteomic signatures of COVID-19 in the urine of critically ill patients indicating interferon pathway upregulation. SARS-CoV-2 viral variants alpha, beta, gamma, kappa, and delta exhibit comparable levels of infection in organoids. Infection is ameliorated in ACE2-/- organoids and blocked via treatment with de novo-designed spike binder peptides. Collectively, these studies clarify the impact of kidney infection in COVID-19 as reflected in organoids and clinical populations, enabling assessment of viral fitness and emerging therapies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global genetic diversity of HIV-1 is a major challenge to the development of HIV vaccines. We aimed to estimate the regional and global distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants during 1990-2015. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebscohost), and Global Health (Ovid) for HIV-1 subtyping studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2015. We collected additional unpublished HIV-1 subtyping data through a global survey. We included prevalence studies with HIV-1 subtyping data collected during 1990-2015. We grouped countries into 14 regions and analysed data for four time periods (1990-99, 2000-04, 2005-09, and 2010-15). The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and unique recombinant forms (URFs) in individual countries was weighted according to the UNAIDS estimates of the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in each country to generate regional and global estimates of HIV-1 diversity in each time period. The primary outcome was the number of samples designated as HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, CRFs, and URFs. The systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017067164. FINDINGS: This systematic review and global survey yielded 2203 datasets with 383\hphantom{,}519 samples from 116 countries in 1990-2015. Globally, subtype C accounted for 46·6\% (16\hphantom{,}280\hphantom{,}897/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639 of PLHIV) of all HIV-1 infections in 2010-15. Subtype B was responsible for 12·1\% (4\hphantom{,}235\hphantom{,}299/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639) of infections, followed by subtype A (10·3\%; 3\hphantom{,}587\hphantom{,}003/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639), CRF02\_AG (7·7\%; 2\hphantom{,}705\hphantom{,}110/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639), CRF01\_AE (5·3\%; 1\hphantom{,}840\hphantom{,}982/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639), subtype G (4·6\%; 1\hphantom{,}591\hphantom{,}276/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639), and subtype D (2·7\%; 926\hphantom{,}255/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639). Subtypes F, H, J, and K combined accounted for 0·9\% (311\hphantom{,}332/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639) of infections. Other CRFs accounted for 3·7\% (1\hphantom{,}309\hphantom{,}082/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639), bringing the proportion of all CRFs to 16·7\% (5\hphantom{,}844\hphantom{,}113/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639). URFs constituted 6·1\% (2\hphantom{,}134\hphantom{,}405/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639), resulting in recombinants accounting for 22·8\% (7\hphantom{,}978\hphantom{,}517/34\hphantom{,}921\hphantom{,}639) of all global HIV-1 infections. The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants changed over time in countries, regions, and globally. At a global level during 2005-15, subtype B increased, subtypes A and D were stable, and subtypes C and G and CRF02\_AG decreased. CRF01\_AE, other CRFs, and URFs increased, leading to a consistent increase in the global proportion of recombinants over time. INTERPRETATION: Global and regional HIV diversity is complex and evolving, and is a major challenge to HIV vaccine development. Surveillance of the global molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 remains crucial for the design, testing, and implementation of HIV vaccines. FUNDING: None.},

  abstract = {Meningitis outcome is associated with the severity of inflammation in the subarachnoid space and that the outcome can be improved through anti-inflammation. However, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis underlying inflammatory responses in meningitis remains enigmatic. In the current study, we sought to determine the molecular mechanism of TLR7/NF-κB on the development of meningitis in children. Cerebrospinal fluid of patients with meningitis and children with simple febrile convulsions was collected, and meningitis mouse model was induced. TLR7 expression was determined in the serum of meningitis model mice and the cerebrospinal fluid of patients using RT-qPCR and Western blot. Afterwards, loss- and gain- function assays were conducted to determine the functional role of TLR7 in meningitis mouse model. The level of procalcitonin (PCT) and the number of bacterial colonies in the serum were analyzed. ELISA was used to detect the expression of inflammatory factors. Upregulated level of TLR7 was observed in patients and mice with meningitis. Inhibiting the expression of TLR7 inhibited the development of meningitis. Overexpressing TLR7 can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and promote mouse meningitis. NF-κB signaling pathway inhibitor reversed promotion of meningitis caused by TLR7 activation. Our study provides evidence that TLR7 elevation can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and promote meningitis in mice.},

We show here that TLR3 regulates host immunity and the loss of TLR3 aggravates pathology in Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. Susceptibility to CHIKV infection is markedly increased in human and mouse fibroblasts with defective TLR3 signaling. Up to 100-fold increase in CHIKV load was observed in Tlr3−/− mice, alongside increased virus dissemination and pro-inflammatory myeloid cells infiltration. Infection in bone marrow chimeric mice showed that TLR3-expressing hematopoietic cells are required for effective CHIKV clearance. CHIKV-specific antibodies from Tlr3−/− mice exhibited significantly lower in vitro neutralization capacity, due to altered virus-neutralizing epitope specificity. Finally, SNP genotyping analysis of CHIKF patients on TLR3 identified SNP rs6552950 to be associated with disease severity and CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibody response. These results demonstrate a key role for TLR3-mediated antibody response to CHIKV infection, virus replication and pathology, providing a basis for future development of immunotherapeutics in vaccine development.},

Faced with an unprecedented health crisis ? 8,000 people dying daily ? the public health community launched an unprecedented global effort that eventually resulted in the large-scale availability of low-priced generic HIV medicines. 0But now, high prices of new medicines - for example, for cancer, tuberculosis and hepatitis C - are limiting access to treatment in low-, middle and high-income countries alike. Patent-based monopolies affect almost all medicines developed since 1995 in most countries, and global health policy is now at a critical juncture if the world is to avoid new access to medicines crises. 0This book discusses lessons learned from the HIV/AIDS crisis, and asks whether actions taken to extend access and save lives are exclusive to HIV or can be applied more broadly to new global access challenges.},

Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.

Mutations associated with two human skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, disturb COMP secretion leading to intracellular accumulation of mutant COMP, especially in chondrocytes. Here we show that the manifestation of this secretory defect is dramatically influenced by the signal peptide that targets COMP for secretion. The comparison of wild type and mutant COMP secretion directed by the COMP or BM40 signal peptide in HEK-293 cells and rat chondrosarcoma cells revealed that the BM40 signal peptide substantially enhances secretion of mutant COMP that accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum-like structures when targeted by its own signal peptide. Additionally, we demonstrate that mutant COMP forms mixed pentamers with wild type COMP. Our findings suggest that the secretory defect in pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is not specific for chondrocytes, nor does it require interaction of mutant COMP with other matrix proteins prior to transport from the cell. They also imply a previously unappreciated role for the signal peptide in the regulation of protein secretion beyond targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) and lymphoma are regarded as distinct diseases with different pathogeneses. However, patients that are diagnosed with both malignancies occur more frequently in the population than expected. This has led to the hypothesis that the two malignancies may, in some cases, be pathogenetically related. Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach, we show that pre-treatment lymphoma samples from patients with both MPN and lymphoma, either angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (MPN-AITL) or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (MPN-DLBCL), show differences in protein expression compared with reference AITL or DLBCL samples from patients without MPN. A distinct clustering of samples from patients with and without MPN was evident for both AITL and DLBCL. Regarding MPN-AITL, a pathway analysis revealed disturbances of cellular respiration as well as oxidative metabolism, and an immunohistochemical evaluation further demonstrated the differential expression of citrate synthase and DNAJA2 protein (p = 0.007 and p = 0.015). Interestingly, IDH2 protein also showed differential expression in the MPN-AITL patients, which contributes to the growing evidence of this protein’s role in both myeloid neoplasia and AITL. In MPN-DLBCL, the disturbed pathways included a significant downregulation of protein synthesis as well as a perturbation of signal transduction. These results imply an underlying disturbance of tumor molecular biology, and in turn an alternative pathogenesis for tumors in these patients with both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a novel cytokine involved in inflammation and cancer development. IL-32 gene consists of eight small exons, and IL-32 mRNA has nine alternative spliced isoforms, and was thought to be secreted because it contains an internal signal sequence and lacks a transmembrane region. IL-32 is initially expressed selectively in activated T cells by mitogen and activated NK cells and their expression is strongly augmented by microbes, mitogens, and other cytokines. The IL-32 is induced mainly by pathogens and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but IL-32 is more prominent in immune cells than in non-immune tissues. The IL-32 transcript is expressed in various human tissues and organs such as the spleen, thymus, leukocyte, lung, small intestine, colon, prostate, heart, placenta, liver, muscle, kidney, pancreas, and brain. Cytokines are critical components of cell signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, metabolism, hormone signaling, immune regulation and a variety of other physiological functions. Earlier studies have demonstrated that IL-32 regulates cell growth, metabolism and immune regulation and is therefore involved in the pathologic regulator or protectant of inflammatory diseases. Previous studies defined that IL-32 is upregulated in the patients with several inflammatory diseases, and is induced by inflammatory responses. However, several reports suggested that IL-32 is downregulated in several inflammatory diseases including asthma, HIV infection disease, neuronal diseases, metabolic disorders, experimental colitis and metabolic disorders. IL-32 is also involved in various cancer malignancies including renal cancer, esophageal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, breast cancer, colon cancer and thyroid carcinoma. Other studies suggested that IL-32 decreases tumor development including cervical cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, review articles that discuss the roles and its mechanism of IL-32 isoforms focusing on the therapeutic approaches have not yet been reported. In this review article, we will discuss recent findings regarding IL-32 in the development of diseases and further discuss therapeutic approaches targeting IL-32. Moreover, we will suggest that IL-32 could be the target of several diseases and the therapeutic agents for targeting IL-32 may have potential beneficial effects for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancers. Future research should open new avenues for the design of novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-32.},

Available evidence has demonstrated that TLRs are implicated in the immunopathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and tumor carcinogenesis. Therefore, we performed the present study to investigate the relationship with TLR3 gene polymorphisms and the risk of HBV-related liver disease in a Chinese population. A total of 623 individuals were included: 172 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 91 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 174 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 186 healthy controls. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of TLR3 rs1879026 and rs3775290 polymorphisms were detected by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing analysis. Association analysis showed that the TT genotype of TLR3 rs3775290 was associated with a decreased risk for CHB, HBV-related LC, and HCC (OR=0.52, 95\% CI: 0.27–0.99, P=0.048; OR=0.32, 95\% CI: 0.14–0.76, P=0.010; OR=0.49, 95\% CI: 0.26–0.92, P=0.027). Nevertheless, a lack of association was found between TLR3 rs1879026 and HBV-related liver diseases. In addition, haplotype analysis revealed that individuals who carried the GT haplotype might have a decreased risk of HBV-related liver diseases. The results indicated that genetic variant in TLR3 gene rs3775290 polymorphisms may be a protective factor for CHB, HBV-related LC, and HCC in the Chinese population.},

However, their actual impact on urban air pollution, especially the factors that might amplify these environmental benefits, is still not well understood. Taking advantage of Ofo and Mobike's staggered entry into 98 major Chinese cities as a quasi-natural experiment, this study empirically examines the impact of technology-enabled dockless bike-sharing services on air pollution and its heterogeneity using a difference-in-differences approach. The results show that there is significant heterogeneity in the impact of the entry of bike-sharing services on urban air pollution, while the overall effect is not significant. Specifically, the reduction effect of dockless bike-sharing service entry on air pollution is greater in cities with larger urban populations, longer average commute times, and higher public transit use, and the increase in traffic congestion further amplifies such effects. This study serves as the first empirical analysis of the impact of bike-sharing services on air pollution, providing important and valuable references for policymakers to better utilize these services to improve air quality and develop sustainable urban transport systems.},

  abstract = {The general secretory pathway (Sec) and twin-arginine translocase (Tat) operate in parallel to export proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotes and the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts. Substrates are targeted to their respective machineries by N-terminal signal peptides that share a tripartite organization; however, Tat signal peptides harbor a conserved and almost invariant arginine pair that is critical for efficient targeting to the Tat machinery. Tat signal peptides interact with a membrane-bound receptor complex comprised of TatB and TatC components, with TatC containing the twin-arginine recognition site. Here, we isolated suppressors in the signal peptide of the Tat substrate, SufI, that restored Tat transport in the presence of inactivating substitutions in the TatC twin-arginine binding site. These suppressors increased signal peptide hydrophobicity, and copurification experiments indicated that they restored binding to the variant TatBC complex. The hydrophobic suppressors could also act in cis to suppress substitutions at the signal peptide twin-arginine motif that normally prevent targeting to the Tat pathway. Highly hydrophobic variants of the SufI signal peptide containing four leucine substitutions retained the ability to interact with the Tat system. The hydrophobic signal peptides of two Sec substrates, DsbA and OmpA, containing twin lysine residues, were shown to mediate export by the Tat pathway and to copurify with TatBC. These findings indicate that there is unprecedented overlap between Sec and Tat signal peptides and that neither the signal peptide twin-arginine motif nor the TatC twin-arginine recognition site is an essential mechanistic feature for operation of the Tat pathway., Protein export is an essential process in all prokaryotes. The Sec and Tat export pathways operate in parallel, with the Sec machinery transporting unstructured precursors and the Tat pathway transporting folded proteins. Proteins are targeted to the Tat pathway by N-terminal signal peptides that contain an almost invariant twin-arginine motif. Here, we make the surprising discovery that the twin arginines are not essential for recognition of substrates by the Tat machinery and that this requirement can be bypassed by increasing the signal peptide hydrophobicity. We further show that signal peptides of bona fide Sec substrates can also mediate transport by the Tat pathway. Our findings suggest that key features of the Tat targeting mechanism have evolved to prevent mistargeting of substrates to the Sec pathway rather than being a critical requirement for function of the Tat pathway.},

  abstract = {The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with progressively increased transmissibility between humans is a threat to global public health. The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 also evades immunity from natural infection or vaccines1, but it is unclear whether its exceptional transmissibility is due to immune evasion or intrinsic virological properties. Here we compared the replication competence and cellular tropism of the wild-type virus and the D614G, Alpha~(B.1.1.7), Beta~(B.1.351), Delta~(B.1.617.2) and Omicron~(B.1.1.529) variants in ex vivo explant cultures of human bronchi and lungs. We also evaluated the dependence on TMPRSS2~and cathepsins for infection. We show that Omicron replicates faster than all other SARS-CoV-2 variants studied in the bronchi but less efficiently in the lung parenchyma. All variants of concern have similar cellular tropism compared to the wild type. Omicron is more dependent on cathepsins than the other variants of concern tested, suggesting that the Omicron variant enters cells through a different route compared with the other variants. The lower replication competence of Omicron in the human lungs may explain the reduced severity of Omicron that is now being reported in epidemiological studies, although determinants of severity are multifactorial. These findings provide important biological correlates to previous epidemiological observations.},

  abstract = {Technological applications, especially the use of multimedia courseware have become more common in today’s education, stimulating innovative approaches in teaching and learning. With the growing interest of integrating information and communication technologies (ICTs) into learning and teaching, the use of multimedia technology and digital games offered an alternate method of instruction. Multimedia objects play an important role in the classroom setting because of its ability to provide a virtual environment for learners to effectively acquire knowledge. This paper presents part of the findings of a research project that focused on the advantages of multimedia technology and the benefits of digital game-based learning. By using sample lessons from an interactive multimedia courseware called “DigiGEMs,” this paper emphasizes the use of digital games as a vital tool in mathematics learning. The study sets out to examine if a positive attitude exists among young learners towards the learning of mathematical concepts. The DigiGEMs is targeted at primary school children aged between 7 to 9 years old, who can practice mathematical thinking skills in an appealing manner. This paper also describes the efficacy of using multimedia and game-based approaches to motivate mathematical learnings among Primary 1 to 3 students. The research findings corroborate with the hypothesis that digital game-based learning is more effective than traditional class-based learning in acquiring mathematical knowledge. It is hoped that the discussion in this paper will encourage other researchers to not only conduct further studies on children’s learnings in the context of digital game-based learning environment in mathematics, but also to adopt game based-learning for other subjects such as science and languages in which the above elements (i.e., multimedia objects and digital games) are cohesively and dynamically integrated to optimise the teaching and learning processes.},

METHODS We randomly assigned HIV-positive adults who had a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter to start antiretroviral therapy immediately (immediate-initiation group) or to defer it until the CD4+ count decreased to 350 cells per cubic millimeter or until the development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or another condition that dictated the use of antiretroviral therapy (deferred-initiation group). The primary composite end point was any serious AIDS-related event, serious non–AIDS-related event, or death from any cause. RESULTS A total of 4685 patients were followed for a mean of 3.0 years. At study entry, the median HIV viral load was 12,759 copies per milliliter, and the median CD4+ count was 651 cells per cubic millimeter. On May 15, 2015, on the basis of an interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board determined that the study question had been answered and recommended that patients in the deferred-initiation group be offered antiretroviral therapy. The primary end point occurred in 42 patients in the immediate-initiation group (1.8\%; 0.60 events per 100 person-years), as compared with 96 patients in the deferred-initiation group (4.1\%; 1.38 events per 100 person-years), for a hazard ratio of 0.43 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.62; P{$<$}0.001). Hazard ratios for serious AIDS-related and serious non–AIDS-related events were 0.28 (95\% CI, 0.15 to 0.50; P{$<$}0.001) and 0.61 (95\% CI, 0.38 to 0.97; P = 0.04), respectively. More than two thirds of the primary end points (68\%) occurred in patients with a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter. The risks of a grade 4 event were similar in the two groups, as were the risks of unscheduled hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS The initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive adults with a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter provided net benefits over starting such therapy in patients after the CD4+ count had declined to 350 cells per cubic millimeter.

  abstract = {Novel influenza A (H1N1) at the origin of the 2009 pandemic flu developed mainly in subjects of less than 65 years contrary to the seasonal influenza, which usually developed in elderly patients of more than 65 years. Elderly subjects are partly protected by old meetings with close stocks. Influenza A(H1N1) can arise in serious forms within 60 to 80\% of cases a fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) "malignant and fulminant influenza" in subjects without any comorbidity, which makes the gravity and the fear of this influenza. The fact that this influenza A (H1N1) can develop in healthy young patients and evolve in few hours to a severe ARDS with a refractory hypoxemia gave to the foreground the possible interest of the recourse to extracorporeal oxygenation (ECMO) in some selected severe ARDS (5-10\%). The first publications of patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) for severe influenza A (H1N1) often associated to an ARDS reported a mortality rate from 15 to 40\%. This mortality variability may be explained in part by different studied populations, ARDS characteristics and human and material resources in the ICUs between the countries. Indeed, the highest mortality rates (30-40\%) have been reported by in Mexico which were affected the first by pandemic flu and which were not prepared. A bacterial pneumonia was associated to H1N1 influenza in approximately 30\% of the cases as at admission in ICU or following the days of the admission justifying an early antibiotherapy associated to the antiviral treatment by oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Obesity, pregnancy and respiratory diseases (asthma, COPD) seem to be associated to the development of a severe viral pneumonia due to influenza A (H1N1) often with ARDS. Older age, high APACHE II and SOFA scores and a delay of initiation of the antiviral treatment by oseltamivir are associated to higher morbidity and mortality. Other analyses of the results obtained from the first published papers included more patients and future studies would permitted to better define the role of therapeutics such as steroids and ECMO.},

  abstract = {Proteins destined for secretion or membrane compartments possess signal peptides for insertion into the membrane. The signal peptide is therefore critical for localization and function of cell surface receptors and ligands that mediate cell-cell communication. About 4\% of all human proteins listed in UniProt database have signal peptide domains in their N terminals. A comprehensive literature survey was performed to retrieve functional and disease associated genetic variants in the signal peptide domains of human proteins. In 21 human proteins we have identified 26 disease associated mutations within their signal peptide domains, 14 mutations of which have been experimentally shown to impair the signal peptide function and thus influence protein transportation. We took advantage of SignalP 3.0 predictions to characterize the signal peptide prediction score differences between the mutant and the wild-type alleles of each mutation, as well as 189 previously uncharacterized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found to be located in the signal peptide domains of 165 human proteins. Comparisons of signal peptide prediction outcomes of mutations and SNPs, have implicated SNPs potentially impacting the signal peptide function, and thus the cellular localization of the human proteins. The majority of the top candidate proteins represented membrane and secreted proteins that are associated with molecular transport, cell signaling and cell to cell interaction processes of the cell. This is the first study that systematically characterizes genetic variation occurring in the signal peptides of all human proteins. This study represents a useful strategy for prioritization of SNPs occurring within the signal peptide domains of human proteins. Functional evaluation of candidates identified herein may reveal effects on major cellular processes including immune cell function, cell recognition and adhesion, and signal transduction.},

  abstract = {Objectives Studies are needed to better understand the genomic evolution of the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study aimed to describe genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a patient with longitudinal follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Sequential samples collected between January 29th and February 4th, 2020, from a patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 were used to perform amplification of two genome fragments—including genes encoding spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins—and NGS was carried out with Illumina® technology. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with PhyML and viral variant identification with VarScan. Results Majority consensus sequences were identical in most of the samples (5/7) and differed in one synonymous mutation from the Wuhan reference sequence. We identified 233 variants; each sample harboured in median 38 different minority variants, and only four were shared by different samples. The frequency of mutation was similar between genes and correlated with the length of the gene (r~=~0.93, p = 0.0002). Most of mutations were substitution variations (n~=~217, 93.1\%) and about 50\% had moderate or high impact on gene expression. Viral variants also differed between lower and upper respiratory tract samples collected on the same day, suggesting independent sites of replication of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions We report for the first time minority viral populations representing up to 1\% during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Quasispecies were different from one day to the next, as well as between anatomical sites, suggesting that in~vivo this new coronavirus appears as a complex and dynamic distributions of variants.},

  abstract = {We have previously shown that double-stranded RNA-triggered, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated signaling is independent of MyD88, IRAK4, and IRAK. Instead, TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 are recruited to TLR3 on poly(I·C) stimulation. TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2 are then translocated to the cytosol where TAK1 is phosphorylated and activated, leading to the activation of IκB kinase and NFκB. The present study addressed two important questions: (i) How are TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 recruited to TLR3? (ii) Are TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 also required for TLR3-mediated IRF3 activation? Recently, a novel Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR)-containing adapter, TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β (TRIF), was shown to play a critical role in TLR3-mediated activation of NF-κB and IRF3. We found that TLR3 recruits TRAF6 via adapter TRIF through a TRAF6-binding sequence in TRIF (PEEMSW, amino acids 250-255). Mutation of this TRAF6-binding sequence abolished the interaction of TRIF with TRAF6, but not with TLR3. Interestingly, mutation of the TRAF6-binding site of TRIF only abolished its ability to activate NF-κB but not IRF3, suggesting that TLR3-mediated activation of NF-κB and IRF3 might bifurcate at TRIF. In support of this finding, we showed that DN-TRAF6 and DN-TAK1 blocked poly(I·C)-induced NF-κB but not IRF3 activation. Furthermore, whereas poly(I·C)-induced NF-κB activation is completely abolished inTRAF6-/- MEFs, the signal-induced activation of IRF3 is TRAF6 independent. In conclusion, TRIF recruits TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2 to TLR3 through its TRAF6-binding site, which is required for NF-κB but not IRF3 activation. Therefore, double-stranded RNA-induced TLR3/TRIF-mediated NF-κB and IRF3 activation diverge at TRIF.},

  abstract = {HIV/AIDS mortality has been decreasing over the last decade. While promising, this decrease correlated directly with increased use of antiretroviral drugs. As a natural consequence of its high mutation rate, treatments provide selection pressure that promotes the natural selection of escape mutants. Individuals may acquire drug-naive strains, or those that have already mutated due to treatment. Even within a host, mutation affects HIV tropism, where initial infection begins with R5-tropic virus, but the clinical transition to AIDS correlates with mutations that lead to an X4-tropic switch. Furthermore, the high mutation rate of HIV has spelled failure for all attempts at an effective vaccine. Pre-exposure drugs are currently the most effective drug-based preventatives, but their effectiveness is also threatened by viral mutation. From attachment and entry to assembly and release, the steps in the replication cycle are also discussed to describe the drug mechanisms and mutations that arise due to those drugs. Revealing the patterns of HIV-1 mutations, their effects, and the coordinated attempt to understand and control them will lead to effective use of current preventative measures and treatment options, as well as the development of new ones.},

The formation of autoantibodies and the deposition of antibody-containing immune complexes in blood vessels throughout the body is the main pathogenic mechanism of SLE leading to heterogeneous clinical manifestations and target tissue damage. The complexity of etiology and pathogenesis in SLE, enclosing genetic and environmental factors, apparently is one of the greatest challenges for both researchers and clinicians. Strong indications for a genetic background in SLE come from studies in families as well as in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, discovering several SLE-associated loci and genes (e.g. IRF5, PTPN22, CTLA4, STAT4 and BANK1). As SLE has a complex genetic background, none of these genes is likely to be entirely responsible for triggering autoimmune response in SLE even if they disclosure a potentially novel molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis' disease. The clinical manifestations and disease severity varies greatly among patients, thus several studies try to associate clinical heterogeneity and prognosis with specific genetic polymorphisms in SLE associated genes. The continue effort to describe new predisposing or modulating genes in SLE is justified by the limited knowledge about the pathogenesis, assorted clinical manifestation and the possible prevention strategies. In this review we describe newly discovered, as well as the most studied genes associated to SLE susceptibility, and relate them to clinical manifestations of the disease.},

The goal of this review is to equip the reader with the conceptual tools and substantive background needed to understand and evaluate the policy and programmatic implications of cost-effectiveness assessments of ART for prevention. We provide this review in six sections. We start by introducing and explaining basic concepts of health economics as they relate to this issue, including resources, costs, health metrics (such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years), and different types of economic analysis. We then review research on the cost and cost-effectiveness of ART as treatment, and on the cost-effectiveness of traditional HIV prevention. We describe critical issues in the epidemic impact of ART, such as suppression of transmission and the role of the acute phase of infection. We then present a conceptual model for conducting and interpreting cost-effectiveness analyses of ART as prevention, and review the existing preliminary estimates in this area. We end with a discussion of future directions for programmatic demonstrations and evaluation.},

In this review, we discuss the emerging role that CTLs have in HIV cure efforts, with particular emphasis on epitope specificity. Recent studies have demonstrated that successful in vivo containment of the virus is rooted in the specific targeting of fitness-constrained, mutation-resistant regions of the HIV proteome.

  abstract = {Background TILRR (Toll-like Interleukin-1 Receptor Regulator) is a modulator of many genes in NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling. It promotes the production of inflammatory mediators and the migration of immune cells. Recently, we showed that TILRR protein circulates in human blood. Thus, it could influence systemic inflammation. Systemic and mucosal inflammations increase the susceptibility to HIV infection. In this study, we analyzed the TILRR protein levels of the archived plasma samples of women enrolled in the Pumwani cohort to determine whether the plasma TILRR protein levels before seroconversion are correlated with differential risk of HIV seroconversion. Methods TILRR protein of 941 archived HIV negative plasma samples from 390 women who were HIV negative at the cohort enrollment was quantified with an in-house developed multiplex bead array method. Proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were measured using a 14-plex bead array method. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between plasma TILRR protein and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to evaluate whether the median plasma TILRR protein levels correlate with increased risk of HIV seroconversion. Findings The level of plasma TILRR protein was positively correlated with plasma IL-1β (rho: 0.2593, p{$<$}0.0001), MCP-1 (rho: 0.2377, p{$<$}0.0001), and IL-17A (rho: 0.1225, p=0.0216). Women with median plasma TILRR protein levels ≥100 ng/ml seroconverted significantly faster than women with plasma TILRR protein levels {$<$}100 ng/ml (log-rank= 100.124, p{$<$}0.0001; relative risk= 3.72 and odds ratio= 15.29). Furthermore, the factors causing genital inflammation, such as STIs (sexually transmitted infections), vaginal discharge, and genital ulcers were not statistically significantly different among women with different median plasma TILRR protein levels. Interpretation The high plasma TILRR protein levels are highly correlated with several plasma proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. High median plasma TILRR protein (≥100 ng/ml) strongly predicted an increased risk of HIV seroconversion. Reducing plasma TILRR protein levels may reduce the risk of HIV acquisition.

It is generally accepted that HIV-related stigma is correlated with factors that may undermine ART adherence, but its relationship with ART adherence itself is not well established. We therefore undertook this review to systematically assess the relationship between HIV-related stigma and ART adherence. METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases for published and unpublished literature, with no language restrictions. First we screened the titles and abstracts for studies that potentially contained data on ART adherence. Then we reviewed the full text of these studies to identify articles that reported data on the relationship between ART adherence and either HIV-related stigma or serostatus disclosure. We used the method of meta-synthesis to summarize the findings from the qualitative studies. RESULTS: Our search protocol yielded 14,854 initial records. After eliminating duplicates and screening the titles and abstracts, we retrieved the full text of 960 journal articles, dissertations and unpublished conference abstracts for review. We included 75 studies conducted among 26,715 HIV-positive persons living in 32 countries worldwide, with less representation of work from Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Among the 34 qualitative studies, our meta-synthesis identified five distinct third-order labels through an inductive process that we categorized as themes and organized in a conceptual model spanning intrapersonal, interpersonal and structural levels. HIV-related stigma undermined ART adherence by compromising general psychological processes, such as adaptive coping and social support. We also identified psychological processes specific to HIV-positive persons driven by predominant stigmatizing attitudes and which undermined adherence, such as internalized stigma and concealment. Adaptive coping and social support were critical determinants of participants' ability to overcome the structural and economic barriers associated with poverty in order to successfully adhere to ART. Among the 41 quantitative studies, 24 of 33 cross-sectional studies (71\%) reported a positive finding between HIV stigma and ART non-adherence, while 6 of 7 longitudinal studies (86\%) reported a null finding (Pearson's χ (2)=7.7; p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: We found that HIV-related stigma compromised participants' abilities to successfully adhere to ART. Interventions to reduce stigma should target multiple levels of influence (intrapersonal, interpersonal and structural) in order to have maximum effectiveness on improving ART adherence.},

  abstract = {During viral and bacterial infections, the innate immune system recognizes various types of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as nucleic acids, via a series of membrane-bound or cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors. These include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), AIM2-like receptors (ALRs), and cytosolic DNA sensors. The binding of PAMPs to these receptors triggers the production of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN induces the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which protect surrounding cells from infection. Some ISGs are nucleic acids-binding proteins that bind viral nucleic acids and suppress their replication. As nucleic acids are essential components that store and transmit genetic information in every species, infectious pathogens have developed systems to escape from the host nucleic acid recognition system. Host cells also have their own nucleic acids that are frequently released to the extracellular milieu or the cytoplasm during cell death or stress responses, which, if able to bind pattern-recognition receptors, would induce autoimmunity and inflammation. Therefore, host cells have acquired mechanisms to protect themselves from contact with their own nucleic acids. In this review, we describe recent research progress into the nucleic acid recognition mechanism and the molecular bases of discrimination between self and non-self-nucleic acids.},

  abstract = {Introduction The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants, identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population. Methods A case-control association study was conducted on eight tag SNPs in the TLR7 region, including rs3853839, in 344 Japanese females with SLE and 274 healthy female controls. Results In addition to rs3853839, two SNPs in intron 2, rs179019 and rs179010, which were in moderate linkage disequilibrium with each other (r2 = 0.53), showed an association with SLE (rs179019: P = 0.016, odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.15 to 3.54; rs179010: P = 0.018, OR 1.75, 95\% CI 1.10 to 2.80 (both under the recessive model)). Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that the association of the intronic SNPs and the 3' UTR SNP remained significant after we adjusted them for each other. When only the patients and controls carrying the risk genotypes at the 3' UTR SNPpositionwere analyzed, the risk of SLE was significantly increased when the individuals also carried the risk genotypes at both of the intronic SNPs (P = 0.0043, OR 2.45, 95\% CI 1.31 to 4.60). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the intronic risk alleles in addition to the 3' UTR risk allele was associated with SLE under the recessive model (P = 0.016, OR 2.37, 95\% CI 1.17 to 4.80), but other haplotypes were not associated with SLE. Conclusions The TLR7 intronic SNPs rs179019 and rs179010 are associated with SLE independently of the 3' UTR SNP rs3853839 in Japanese women. Our findings support a role of TLR7 in predisposition for SLE in Asian populations.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding in humans remain poorly understood. We captured the dynamics of infectious virus and viral RNA shedding during acute infection through daily longitudinal sampling of 60\,individuals for up to 14\,days. By fitting mechanistic models, we directly estimated viral expansion and clearance rates and overall infectiousness for each individual. Significant person-to-person variation in infectious virus shedding suggests that individual-level heterogeneity in viral dynamics contributes to ‘superspreading’. Viral genome loads often peaked days earlier in saliva than in nasal swabs, indicating strong tissue compartmentalization and suggesting that saliva may serve as a superior sampling site for early detection of infection. Viral loads and clearance kinetics of Alpha (B.1.1.7) and previously circulating non-variant-of-concern viruses were mostly indistinguishable, indicating that the enhanced transmissibility of this variant cannot be explained simply by higher viral loads or delayed clearance. These results provide a high-resolution portrait of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and implicate individual-level heterogeneity in infectiousness in superspreading.},

A total of 69 articles ultimately met the inclusion criteria and were coded for the literature synthesis. Exemplary learning games cited in the articles reviewed and developed by credible institutions were also analyzed. The cumulative findings and propositions of the game-based learning-play integration have been extracted and synthesized into five salient themes to clarify what, how, where, and when learning and content are embedded in and activated by gameplay. These themes highlight: (a) the types of game-based learning action—prior-knowledge activation and novel-knowledge acquisition, (b) the modes in which learning actions are integrated in game actions—representation, simulation, and contextualization, (c) the blended learning spaces contrived by game mechanics and the game world, (d) the occurrence of meta-reflective and iterative learning moments during game play, and (e) the multifaceted in-game learning support (or scaffolding). Future directions for the design and research of learning integration in digital games are then proposed.},

  abstract = {Background The increased levels of blood cytokines is the main immunopathological process that were attributed to severe clinical outcomes in cases of influenza A, influenza B and people with influenza-like illness (ILI). Functional genetic polymorphisms caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in inflammatory cytokines genes can influence their functions either qualitatively or quantitatively, which is associated with the possibility of severe influenza infections. The aim of the present case-control study was to investigate the association of polymorphisms in inflammatory cytokines genes with influenza patients and ILI group in an Iranian population. Methods Total number of 30 influenza B, 50 influenza A (H1N1) and 96 ILI inpatient individuals were confirmed by Real-time RT-PCR and HI assays. The genotype determination was assessed for defined SNPs in IL-1β, IL-17, IL-10 and IL-28 genes. Results The frequencies of the IL-1β rs16944 (P\,=\,0.007) and IL-17 rs2275913 (P\,=\,0.006) genotypes were associated with severe influenza disease, while the frequencies of IL-10 rs1800872 and IL-28 rs8099917 were not associated with the disease (P\,{$>$}\,0.05). Also, the absence of A allele in IL-17 rs2275913 SNP increased the risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection (P\,=\,0.008). Conclusions This study demonstrated that influenza A- (H1N1) and B-infected patients and also ILI controls have different profiles of immune parameters, and individuals carrying the specific cytokine-derived polymorphisms may show different immune responses towards severe outcome.},

Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a recently identified cytokine, whose gene is located on human chromosome 16 p13.3, with eight exons and six splice variants (IL-32α to IL-32ζ). IL-32α, the most abundant form, is secreted by different types of cells including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, endothelial cells and epithelial cells. It acts as a preferential mediator and effector of abnormal immune responses to multiple inflammatory and auto immune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), etc. It was found to stimulate the induction of various chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). Hence, IL-32 mediates the crucial interplay among immune system and body cells during pathogenesis of various insults. The aim of the present effort is to summarize the role, mechanism of pathogenesis and potential therapeutic applications of IL-32 in different systemic infections and diseased conditions.},

Cytokine storm refers to a set of clinical conditions caused by excessive immune reactions and has been recognized as a leading cause of severe COVID-19. While comparisons have been made between COVID-19 cytokine storm and other kinds of cytokine storm such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cytokine release syndrome, the pathogenesis of cytokine storm has not been clearly elucidated yet. Recent studies have shown that impaired response of type-1 IFNs in early stage of COVID-19 infection played a major role in the development of cytokine storm, and various cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 were involved in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, many clinical evidences have indicated the importance of anti-inflammatory therapy in severe COVID-19. Several approaches are currently being used to treat the observed cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, and expectations are especially high for new cytokine-targeted therapies, such as tocilizumab, anakinra, and baricitinib. Although a number of studies have been conducted on anti-inflammatory treatments for severe COVID-19, no specific recommendations have been made on which drugs should be used for which patients and when. In this review, we provide an overview of cytokine storm in COVID-19 and treatments currently being used to address it. In addition, we discuss the potential therapeutic role of extracorporeal cytokine removal to treat the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Today's traffic environment is not well adapted to the needs of the older pedestrian. Unfortunately, except in the case of children, little is known about the characteristics and behavior of pedestrians. Although the simple fact that older pedestrians walk more slowly than younger ones is easily supported by field data, existing data on walking speeds and start-up time (i.e., the time from the onset of a Walk signal until the pedestrian steps off the curb) have many shortcomings. A series of field studies was conducted to quantify the walking speed and start-up time of pedestrians of various ages under different conditions. Sixteen crosswalks in four urban areas were studied. Data were collected on walking speeds and start-up times relative to site and environmental factors, including street width, posted speed, curb height, grade, number of vehicle travel lanes, signal cycle length, pedestrian-signal type, street functional classification, crosswalk type, and channelization. Data on a subject group of pedestrians who appeared to be 65 years of age or older and a control group of pedestrians under age 65 were collected. Results indicate a broad range of walking speeds among pedestrians. The 15th-percentile walking speed for younger pedestrians (ages 14 to 64) was 1.25 m/sec (4.09 ft/sec); for older pedestrians (ages 65 and over) it was 0.97 m/sec (3.19 ft/sec). For design purposes values of 1.22 m/sec (4 ft/sec) for younger pedestrians and 0.91 m/sec (3 ft/sec) for older pedestrians are appropriate. Results also indicated that walking rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including the functional classification and vehicle volumes on the street being crossed, the street width, weather conditions, the number of pedestrians crossing in a group, the signal cycle length, the timing of the various pedestrian-signal phases, whether right turn on red is allowed, pedestrian signals, medians, curb cuts, crosswalk markings, stop lines, and on-street parking. However, for each of these factors, the effect on crossing speeds, although statistically significant, is not meaningful for design.},

  abstract = {The ClusPro server (https://cluspro.org) is a widely used tool for protein-protein docking. The server provides a simple home page for basic use, requiring only two files in Protein Data Bank format. However, ClusPro also offers a number of advanced options to modify the search that include the removal of unstructured protein regions, applying attraction or repulsion, accounting for pairwise distance restraints, constructing homo-multimers, considering small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, and finding heparin binding sites. Six different energy functions can be used depending on the type of proteins. Docking with each energy parameter set results in ten models defined by centers of highly populated clusters of low energy docked structures. This protocol describes the use of the various options, the construction of auxiliary restraints files, the selection of the energy parameters, and the analysis of the results. Although the server is heavily used, runs are generally completed in {$<$} 4 hours.},

  abstract = {ORF6 is responsible for suppressing the immune response of cells infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is also the most toxic protein of SARS-CoV-2, and its actions are associated with the viral pathogenicity. Here, we study in silico and in vitro the structure of the protein, its interaction with RAE1 and the mechanism of action behind its high toxicity. We show both computationally and experimentally that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6, embedded in the cytoplasmic membranes, binds to RAE1 and sequesters it in the cytoplasm, thus depleting its availability in the nucleus and impairing nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport. This negatively affects the cellular genome stability by compromising the cell cycle progression into the S-phase and by promoting the accumulation of RNA–DNA hybrids. Understanding the multiple ways in which ORF6 affects DNA replication may also have important implications for elucidating the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate its deleterious effects on host cells.},

  abstract = {A movement emerges to challenge the tightening of intellectual property law around the world.At the end of the twentieth century, intellectual property rights collided with everyday life. Expansive copyright laws and digital rights management technologies sought to shut down new forms of copying and remixing made possible by the Internet. International laws expanding patent rights threatened the lives of millions of people around the world living with HIV/AIDS by limiting their access to cheap generic medicines. For decades, governments have tightened the grip of intellectual property law at the bidding of information industries; but recently, groups have emerged around the world to challenge this wave of enclosure with a new counter-politics of “access to knowledge” or “A2K.” They include software programmers who took to the streets to defeat software patents in Europe, AIDS activists who forced multinational pharmaceutical companies to permit copies of their medicines to be sold in poor countries, subsistence farmers defending their rights to food security or access to agricultural biotechnology, and college students who created a new “free culture” movement to defend the digital commons. Access to Knowledge in the Age of Intellectual Property maps this emerging field of activism as a series of historical moments, strategies, and concepts. It gathers some of the most important thinkers and advocates in the field to make the stakes and strategies at play in this new domain visible and the terms of intellectual property law intelligible in their political implications around the world.

  abstract = {The NF-κB signaling pathway has previously been shown to be required for efficient influenza A virus replication, although the molecular mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we identified a specific step of the influenza virus life cycle that is influenced by NF-κB signaling by using two known NF-κB inhibitors and a variety of influenza virus-specific assays. The results of time course experiments suggest that the NF-κB inhibitors Bay11-7082 and ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate inhibited an early postentry step of viral infection, but they did not appear to affect the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex. Instead, we found that the levels of influenza virus genomic RNA (vRNA), but not the corresponding cRNA or mRNA, were specifically reduced by the inhibitors in virus-infected cells, indicating that NF-κB signaling is intimately involved in the vRNA synthesis. Furthermore, we showed that the NF-κB inhibitors specifically diminished influenza virus RNA transcription from the cRNA promoter but not from the vRNA promoter in a reporter assay, a result which is consistent with data obtained from virus-infected cells. The overexpression of the p65 NF-κB molecule could not only eliminate the inhibition but also activate influenza virus RNA transcription from the cRNA promoter. Finally, using p65-specific small interfering RNA, we have shown that p65 knockdown reduced the levels of influenza virus replication and vRNA synthesis. In summary, we have provided evidence showing, for the first time, that the NF-κB host signaling pathway can differentially regulate influenza virus RNA synthesis, which may also offer some new perspectives into understanding the host regulation of RNA synthesis by other RNA viruses.},

Accessing these services can sometimes be difficult, especially for those who do not have access to private automobiles. For such transit dependent people, transit accessibility to these services are crucial. This research measures the travel time by transit to various community services in the City of Toronto from each census tract and homeless shelter as a measure of transit accessibility. Each census tract was scored with an index of social disadvantage using four characteristics from census data. It was found that access was highest in the old City of Toronto due the dense concentration of services and more frequent transit supply. Places in the outer parts of the city face concerning levels of inaccessibility to community services. However, transit access to community services does not vary across the levels of social disadvantage. The travel time matrices generated in this research can serve as a guide for policy analysis for future service expansion.},

Here, we used organoids of the human airways and alveoli to investigate Omicron’s fitness and replicative potential in comparison with earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants. We report that Omicron replicates more rapidly in the airways and has an increased fitness compared to the early 614G variant and Delta. In contrast, Omicron did not replicate productively in human alveolar type 2 cells. Mechanistically, we show that Omicron does not efficiently use TMPRSS2 for entry or spread through cell-cell fusion. Altogether, our data show that Omicron has an altered tropism and protease usage, potentially explaining its higher transmissibility and decreased pathogenicity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Obesity is characterized by the immune activation that eventually dampens insulin sensitivity and changes metabolism. This study explores the impact of different inflammatory/ anti-inflammatory paradigms on the expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) found in adipocyte cultures, adipose tissue, and blood. METHODS: We evaluated by real time PCR the impact of acute surgery stress in vivo (adipose tissue) and macrophages (MCM) in vitro (adipocytes). Weight loss was chosen as an anti-inflammatory model, so TLR were analyzed in fat samples collected before and after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss. Associations with inflammatory and metabolic parameters were analyzed in non-obese and obese subjects, in parallel with gene expression measures taken in blood and isolated adipocytes/ stromal-vascular cells (SVC). Treatments with an agonist of TLR3 were conducted in human adipocyte cultures under normal conditions and upon conditions that simulated the chronic low-grade inflammatory state of obesity. RESULTS: Surgery stress raised TLR1 and TLR8 in subcutaneous (SAT), and TLR2 in SAT and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue, while decreasing VAT TLR3 and TLR4. MCM led to increased TLR2 and diminished TLR3, TLR4, and TLR5 expressions in human adipocytes. The anti-inflammatory impact of weight loss was concomitant with decreased TLR1, TLR3, and TLR8 in SAT. Cross-sectional associations confirmed increased V/ SAT TLR1 and TLR8, and decreased TLR3 in obese patients, as compared with non-obese subjects. As expected, TLR were predominant in SVC and adipocyte precursor cells, even though expression of all of them but TLR8 (very low levels) was also found in ex vivo isolated and in vitro differentiated adipocytes. Among SVC, CD14+ macrophages showed increased TLR1, TLR2, and TLR7, but decreased TLR3 mRNA. The opposite patterns shown for TLR2 and TLR3 in V/ SAT, SVC, and inflamed adipocytes were observed in blood as well, being TLR3 more likely linked to lymphocyte instead of neutrophil counts. On the other hand, decreased TLR3 in adipocytes challenged with MCM dampened lipogenesis and the inflammatory response to Poly(I:C). CONCLUSION: Functional variations in the expression of TLR found in blood and hypertrophied fat depots, namely decreased TLR3 in lymphocytes and inflamed adipocytes, are linked to metabolic inflammation.},

Tissue and cellular tropism is one key to understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. We investigate the expression and subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), within the upper (nasal) and lower (pulmonary) respiratory tracts of human donors using a diverse panel of banked tissues. Here, we report our discovery that the ACE2 receptor protein robustly localizes within the motile cilia of airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or early subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry during host respiratory transmission. We further determine whether ciliary ACE2 expression in the upper airway is influenced by patient demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, or medication use, and show the first mechanistic evidence that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) does not increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection through enhancing the expression of ciliary ACE2 receptor. These findings are crucial to our understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for prevention and control of this virulent pathogen.},

  abstract = {Background SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 which has a widely diverse disease profile. The mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity remain unclear. We set out to identify the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic proteins that through host interactions cause the cellular damages underlying COVID-19 symptomatology. Methods We examined each of the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins for their cytotoxicity in HEK 293~T cells and their subcellular localization in COS-7 cells. We also used Mass-Spec Affinity purification to identify the host proteins interacting~with SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 protein and tested a drug that could inhibit a specific Orf6 and host protein interaction. Results We found that Orf6, Nsp6 and Orf7a induced the highest toxicity when over-expressed in human 293~T cells. All three proteins showed membrane localization in COS-7 cells. We focused on Orf6, which was most cytotoxic and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, autophagosome and lysosomal membranes. Proteomics revealed Orf6 interacts with nucleopore proteins (RAE1, XPO1, RANBP2 and nucleoporins). Treatment with Selinexor, an FDA-approved inhibitor for XPO1, attenuated Orf6-induced cellular toxicity in human 293~T cells. Conclusions Our study revealed Orf6 as a highly pathogenic protein from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, identified its key host interacting proteins, and Selinexor as a drug candidate for directly targeting Orf6 host protein interaction that leads to cytotoxicity.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IFITM3, TLR3, and CD55 genes and influenza clinical outcomes in Chinese. METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted on 275 adult cases of avian (H7N9) and pandemic (H1N1pdm09) influenza. Host DNA was extracted from diagnostic respiratory samples; IFITM3 rs12252, TLR3 rs5743313, CD55 rs2564978, and TLR4 rs4986790/4986791 were targeted for genotyping (Sanger sequencing). The primary outcome analyzed was death. RESULTS: IFITM3 and TLR3 SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; their allele frequencies (IFITM3/C-allele 0.56, TLR3/C-allele 0.88) were comparable to 1000 Genomes Han Chinese data. We found over-representation of homozygous IFITM3 CC (54.5\% vs 33.2\%; P = .02) and TLR3 CC (93.3\% vs 76.9\%; P = .04) genotypes among fatal cases. Recessive genetic models showed their significant independent associations with higher death risks (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-6.02, and aHR 4.85, 95\% CI 1.11-21.06, respectively). Cumulative effects were found (aHR 3.53, 95\% CI 1.64-7.59 per risk genotype; aHR 9.99, 95\% CI 1.27-78.59 with both). Results were consistent for each influenza subtype and other severity indicators. The CD55 TT genotype was linked to severity. TLR4 was nonpolymorphic. CONCLUSIONS: Host genetic factors may influence clinical outcomes of avian and pandemic influenza infections. Such findings have important implications on disease burden and patient care in at-risk populations.},

When the null hypothesis is rejected in a validation, MCTs are performed when certain experimental conditions have a statistically significant mean difference or there is a specific aspect between the group means. A problem occurs if the error rate increases while multiple hypothesis tests are performed simultaneously. Consequently, in an MCT, it is necessary to control the error rate to an appropriate level. In this paper, we discuss how to test multiple hypotheses simultaneously while limiting type I error rate, which is caused by α inflation. To choose the appropriate test, we must maintain the balance between statistical power and type I error rate. If the test is too conservative, a type I error is not likely to occur. However, concurrently, the test may have insufficient power resulted in increased probability of type II error occurrence. Most researchers may hope to find the best way of adjusting the type I error rate to discriminate the real differences between observed data without wasting too much statistical power. It is expected that this paper will help researchers understand the differences between MCTs and apply them appropriately.},

  abstract = {The pandemic of COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented threat to global public health. However, the interplay between the viral pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and host innate immunity is poorly understood. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces overt but delayed type-I interferon (IFN) responses. By screening 23 viral proteins, we find that SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, NSP3, NSP12, NSP13, NSP14, ORF3, ORF6 and M protein inhibit Sendai virus-induced IFN-β promoter activation, whereas NSP2 and S protein exert opposite effects. Further analyses suggest that ORF6 inhibits both type I IFN production and downstream signaling, and that the C-terminus region of ORF6 is critical for its antagonistic effect. Finally, we find that IFN-β treatment effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication. In summary, our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 perturbs host innate immune response via both its structural and nonstructural proteins, and thus provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2., The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 post a significant threat to public health. Here the authors show, by screening 23 viral proteins, that both structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins are capable of modulating host innate immunity and type interferon responses, with this information serves to warrant further studies on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Within-patient HIV evolution reflects the strong selection pressure driving viral escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) recognition. Whether this intrapatient accumulation of escape mutations translates into HIV evolution at the population level has not been evaluated. We studied over 300 patients drawn from the B- and C-clade epidemics, focusing on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles HLA-B57 and HLA-B5801, which are associated with long-term HIV control and are therefore likely to exert strong selection pressure on the virus. The CTL response dominating acute infection in HLA-B57/5801-positive subjects drove positive selection of an escape mutation that reverted to wild-type after transmission to HLA-B57/5801-negative individuals. A second escape mutation within the epitope, by contrast, was maintained after transmission. These data show that the process of accumulation of escape mutations within HIV is not inevitable. Complex epitope- and residue-specific selection forces, including CTL-mediated positive selection pressure and virus-mediated purifying selection, operate in tandem to shape HIV evolution at the population level.},

While originally farm dogs that were used for pulling carts, guarding, and driving cattle, today they are considered multi-purpose companion and family dogs. The breed is predisposed to several complex diseases, such as histiocytic sarcoma, degenerative myelopathy, or hip dysplasia. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, we assessed the genomic architecture of 33 unrelated dogs from four countries: France, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Analysis of runs of homozygosity (ROH) identified 12,643 ROH with an average length of 2.29 Mb and an average inbreeding coefficient of 0.395. Multidimensional scaling analysis of the genetic relatedness revealed limited clustering of European versus USA dogs, suggesting exchanges of breeding stock between continents. Furthermore, only two mtDNA haplotypes were detected in the 33 studied dogs, both of which are widespread throughout multiple dog breeds. WGS-based ROH analyses revealed several fixed or nearly fixed regions harboring discreet morphological trait-associated as well as disease-associated genetic variants. Several genes involved in the regulation of immune cells were found in the ROH shared by all dogs, which is notable in the context of the breed's strong predisposition to hematopoietic cancers. High levels of inbreeding and relatedness, strongly exaggerated in the last 30 years, have likely led to the high prevalence of specific genetic disorders in this breed.},

  abstract = {The lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS by interacting with a large number of different cells in the body and escaping the host immune response against it. HIV is transmitted primarily through blood and genital fluids and to newborn infants from infected mothers. The steps occurring in infection involve an interaction of HIV not only with the CD4 molecule on cells but also with other cellular receptors recently identified. Virus-cell fusion and HIV entry subsequently take place. Following virus infection, a variety of intracellular mechanisms determine the relative expression of viral regulatory and accessory genes leading to productive or latent infection. With CD4+ lymphocytes, HIV replication can cause syncytium formation and cell death; with other cells, such as macrophages, persistent infection can occur, creating reservoirs for the virus in many cells and tissues. HIV strains are highly heterogeneous, and certain biologic and serologic properties determined by specific genetic sequences can be linked to pathogenic pathways and resistance to the immune response. The host reaction against HIV, through neutralizing antibodies and particularly through strong cellular immune responses, can keep the virus suppressed for many years. Long-term survival appears to involve infection with a relatively low-virulence strain that remains sensitive to the immune response, particularly to control by CD8+ cell antiviral activity. Several therapeutic approaches have been attempted, and others are under investigation. Vaccine development has provided some encouraging results, but the observations indicate the major challenge of preventing infection by HIV. Ongoing research is necessary to find a solution to this devastating worldwide epidemic.},

However, the immune responses naturally induced in HIV-infected individuals rarely eradicate HIV infection, which may be caused by immune escape, an inadequate magnitude and breadth of immune responses, and immune exhaustion. Optimizing these immune responses may solve the problems of epitope escape and insufficient sustained memory responses. Moreover, immune interventions aimed at improving host immune response can reduce HIV reservoirs, which have become one focus in the development of innovative strategies to eliminate HIV reservoirs. In this review, we focus on the immune response against HIV and how antiviral immune responses affect HIV reservoirs. We also discuss the development of innovative strategies aiming to eliminate HIV reservoirs and promoting functional cure of HIV infection.},

  abstract = {With the global order today undergoing rapid transition, Singapore endeavors to harness data, information and communication technologies (ICT), and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve living, create economic opportunities, and build closer communities in its transformation toward a Smart Nation. Singapore’s urban built environment has become more complex with increased multilevel land use below and above the ground. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) maps are, therefore, increasingly inadequate to support effective management of the city. To address the issue, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) leads a whole-of-government (WHOG) initiative to create and maintain a geometrically accurate three-dimensional (3D) national topographic map and high-quality 3D datasets that capture fundamental as-built 3D information of buildings, terrain, and roads. These datasets serve as the authoritative base map which can be shared across government agencies to satisfy the increasing needs of government and agencies in smart operation, development planning, policymaking, and risk management. This chapter introduces the technological innovations that have been adopted to make changes in multiagency collaboration, as well as making a difference in the city experience of Singapore for social innovation. As a case study, the chapter explores the drivers, actors, and innovative aspects of developing a web-based geospatial platform integrating different 2D and 3D data and models. The platform integrates an intelligent environment decision support system (IEDSS) and a quantitative urban environment simulation tool (QUEST) to facilitate citizen-based and multiagency collaboration in urban planning, design, and resource allocation.},

SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 antagonizes host interferon signaling by inhibition of mRNA nuclear export through its interactions with the ribonucleic acid export 1 (Rae1)–nucleoporin 98 (Nup98) complex. Here, we confirmed the direct tight binding of Orf6 to the Rae1-Nup98 complex, which competitively inhibits RNA binding. We determined the crystal structures of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 Orf6 C-termini in complex with the Rae1–Nup98 heterodimer. In each structure, SARS-CoV Orf6 occupies the same potential mRNA-binding groove of the Rae1–Nup98 complex, comparable to the previously reported structures of other viral proteins complexed with Rae1-Nup98, indicating that the Rae1–Nup98 complex is a common target for different viruses to impair the nuclear export pathway. Structural analysis and biochemical studies highlight the critical role of the highly conserved methionine (M58) of SARS-CoVs Orf6. Altogether our data unravel a mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoVs Orf6 targeting the mRNA-binding site of the Rae1–Nup98 complex to compete with the nuclear export of host mRNA, which further emphasizes that Orf6 is a critical virulence factor of SARS-CoVs.},

  abstract = {Background The origin recognition complex (ORC), a six-subunit DNA-binding complex, participates in DNA replication in cancer cells. Specifically in prostate cancers, ORC participates the androgen receptor (AR) regulated genomic amplification and tumor proliferation throughout the entire cell cycle. Of note, ORC6, the smallest subunit of ORC, has been reported to be dysregulated in some types of cancers (including prostate cancer), however, its prognostic and immunological significances remain yet to be elucidated. Methods In the current study, we comprehensively investigated the potential prognostic and immunological role of ORC6 in 33 human tumors using multiple databases, such as TCGA, Genotype-Tissue Expression, CCLE, UCSC Xena, cBioPortal, Human Protein Atlas, GeneCards, STRING, MSigDB, TISIDB, and TIMER2 databases. Results ORC6 expression was significantly upregulated in 29 types of cancers compared to the corresponding normal adjacent tissues. ORC6 overexpression correlated with higher stage and worse prognostic outcomes in most cancer types analyzed. Additionally, ORC6 was involved in the cell cycle pathway, DNA replication, and mismatch repair pathways in most tumor types. A negative correlation was observed between the tumor endothelial cell infiltration and ORC6 expression in almost all tumors, whereas the immune infiltration of T regulatory cell was noted to be statistically positively correlated with the expression of ORC6 in prostate cancer tissues. Furthermore, in most tumor types, immunosuppression-related genes, especially TGFBR1 and PD-L1 (CD274), exhibited a specific correlation with the expression of ORC6. Conclusions This comprehensive pan-cancer analysis revealed that ORC6 expression serves as a prognostic biomarker and that ORC6 is involved in the regulation of various biological pathways, the tumor microenvironment, and the immunosuppression status in several human cancers, suggesting its potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value in pan-cancer, especially in prostate adenocarcinoma.

The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical features and outcomes of adult patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with H1N1 pneumonia related ARDS. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with confirmed H1N1 influenza pneumonia admitted to the ICUs of a medical center between July 2009 and May 2014. We investigated the patients' characteristics, clinical presentations, illness severities, and outcomes. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were confirmed to have H1N1 influenza pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Fifty-four of those patients (82\%) developed ARDS, while their hospital mortality rate was 33\% (22/66). There were no significant differences in the ICU and hospital mortality rates of the ARDS and non-ARDS patients. Among the ARDS patients, there were higher rates of solid malignant disease (22.8\% vs. 2.8\%, p~=~0.038) and sepsis (66.7\% vs. 33.3\%, p~=~0.020) and a higher mean tidal volume (8.9~±~1.8 vs. 7.8~±~1.9~ml/kg, p~=~0.032) in the non-survivors than the survivors. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a high tidal volume (odds ratio~=~1.448, 95 \% CI~=~1.033-2.030; p~=~0.032) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (odds ratio~=~1.233, 95\% CI~=~1.029-1.478; p~=~0.023) were the risk factors of hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: For H1N1 influenza pneumonia patients admitted to ICUs with mechanical ventilation, there is a high probability of developing ARDS with a modest mortality rate. For patients with ARDS due to H1N1 influenza pneumonia, the tidal volume and SOFA score are the predictors of hospital mortality.},

  abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently associated with pathogen infection–induced chronic inflammation. Large numbers of innate immune cells are present in HCCs and can influence disease outcome. Here, we demonstrated that the tumor suppressor serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (STK4) differentially regulates TLR3/4/9-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages and thereby is protective against chronic inflammation–associated HCC. STK4 dampened TLR4/9-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion but enhanced TLR3/4-triggered IFN-β production via binding to and phosphorylating IL-1 receptor–associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), leading to IRAK1 degradation. Notably, macrophage-specific Stk4 deletion resulted in chronic inflammation, liver fibrosis, and HCC in mice treated with a combination of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and CCl4, along with either LPS or E. coli infection. STK4 expression was markedly reduced in macrophages isolated from human HCC patients and was inversely associated with the levels of IRAK1, IL-6, and phospho-p65 or phospho-STAT3. Moreover, serum STK4 levels were specifically decreased in HCC patients with high levels of IL-6. In STK4-deficient mice, treatment with an IRAK1/4 inhibitor after DEN administration reduced serum IL-6 levels and liver tumor numbers to levels similar to those observed in the control mice. Together, our results suggest that STK4 has potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for inflammation-induced HCC.},

Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently utilized ACE2 of 9 species to infect 293T cells. Similarly, pseudoviruses bearing S protein derived from either the bat RaTG13 or pangolin GX, two closely related animal coronaviruses, utilized ACE2 of a diverse range of animal species to gain entry. Removal of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 S protein displayed distinct effects on pseudoviral entry into different cell types. Unexpectedly, insertion of PRRA into the RaTG13 S protein selectively abrogated the usage of horseshoe bat and pangolin ACE2 but enhanced the usage of mouse ACE2 by the relevant pseudovirus to enter cells. Together, our findings identified a previously unrecognized effect of the PRRA insert on SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 S proteins.ImportanceThe four-residue insert (PRRA) at the boundary between the S1and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 has been widely recognized since day 1 for its role in SARS-CoV-2 S protein processing and activation. As this PRRA insert is unique to SARS-CoV-2 among group b betacoronaviruses, it is thought to affect the tissue and species tropism of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the usage of 10 ACE2 orthologs and found that the presence of PRRA not only affects the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 but also modulates the usage of ACE2 orthologs by the closely related bat RaTG13 S protein. The binding of pseudovirions carrying RaTG13 S with a PRRA insert to mouse ACE2 was nearly 2-fold higher than that of pseudovirions carrying RaTG13 S.},

  abstract = {Background Testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT) is highly heritable but {$>$} 50\% of the genetic risk remains unexplained. Epidemiological observation of greater relative risk to brothers of men with TGCT compared to sons has long alluded to recessively acting TGCT genetic susceptibility factors, but to date none have been reported. Runs of homozygosity (RoH) are a signature indicating underlying recessively acting alleles and have been associated with increased risk of other cancer types. Objective To examine whether RoH are associated with TGCT risk. Methods We performed a genome-wide RoH analysis using GWAS data from 3206 TGCT cases and 7422 controls uniformly genotyped using the OncoArray platform. Results Global measures of homozygosity were not significantly different between cases and controls, and the frequency of individual consensus RoH was not significantly different between cases and controls, after correction for multiple testing. RoH at three regions, 11p13-11p14.3, 5q14.1-5q22.3 and 13q14.11-13q.14.13, were, however, nominally statistically significant at p {$<$} 0.01. Intriguingly, RoH200 at 11p13-11p14.3 encompasses Wilms tumour 1 (WT1), a recognized cancer susceptibility gene with roles in sex determination and developmental transcriptional regulation, processes repeatedly implicated in TGCT aetiology. Discussion and conclusion Overall, our data do not support a major role in the risk of TGCT for recessively acting alleles acting through homozygosity, as measured by RoH in outbred populations of cases and controls.},

Triggers that start the reaction are infection, systemic diseases and rarely anaphylaxis. Cytokine storm is frequently mentioned in connection to medical interventions such as transplantation or administration of drugs., Presented mini-review would like to show current possibilities how to fight or even stop such a life-threatening, immune-mediated process in order to save lives, not only in COVID-19 patients., Early identification of rising state and multilevel course of treatment is imperative. The most widely used molecule for systemic treatment remains tocilizumab. Except for anti IL-6 treatment, contemporary research opens the possibilities for combination of pharmaceutical, non-pharmaceutical and adjunctive treatment in a successful fight with consequences of cytokine storm., Further work is needed to discover the exact signaling pathways that lead to cytokine storm and to determine how these effector molecules and/or combination of processes can help to resolve this frequently fatal episode of inflammation. It is a huge need for all scientists and clinicians to establish a physiological rational for new therapeutic targets that might lead to more personalized medicine approaches.},

  abstract = {Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes dsRNA and initiates an innate immune response through the formation of a signaling unit (SU) composed of one double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and two TLR3 molecules. We report the crystal structure of human TLR3 ectodomain (TLR3ecd) in a quaternary complex with three neutralizing Fab fragments. Fab15 binds an epitope that overlaps the C-terminal dsRNA binding site and, in biochemical assays, blocks the interaction of TLR3ecd with dsRNA, thus directly antagonizing TLR3 signaling through inhibition of SU formation. In contrast, Fab12 and Fab1068 bind TLR3ecd at sites distinct from the N- and C-terminal regions that interact with dsRNA and do not inhibit minimal SU formation with short dsRNA. Molecular modeling based on the co-structure rationalizes these observations by showing that both Fab12 and Fab1068 prevent lateral clustering of SUs along the length of the dsRNA ligand. This model is further supported by cell-based assay results using dsRNA ligands of lengths that support single and multiple SUs. Thus, their antagonism of TLR3 signaling indicates that lateral clustering of SUs is required for TLR3 signal transduction.},

  abstract = {A year into the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, we are experiencing waves of new variants emerging. Some of these variants have worrying functional implications, such as increased transmissibility or antibody treatment escape. Lythgoe et al. have undertaken in-depth sequencing of more than 1000 hospital patients' isolates to find out how the virus is mutating within individuals. Overall, there seem to be consistent and reproducible patterns of within-host virus diversity. The authors observed only one or two variants in most samples, but a few carried many variants. Although the evidence indicates strong purifying selection, including in the spike protein responsible for viral entry, the authors also saw evidence for transmission clusters associated with households and other possible superspreader events. After transmission, most variants fizzled out, but occasionally some initiated ongoing transmission and wider dissemination., Science, this issue p. eabg0821, More than a thousand deep-sequenced clinical samples from the UK reveal that SARS-CoV-2 has limited genetic diversity within most individuals., Extensive global sampling and sequencing of the pandemic virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have enabled researchers to monitor its spread and to identify concerning new variants. Two important determinants of variant spread are how frequently they arise within individuals and how likely they are to be transmitted. To characterize within-host diversity and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted.},

  abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections. Immunity to RSV is initiated upon detection of the virus by pattern recognition receptors, such as RIG-I-like receptors. RIG-I-like receptors signal via MAVS to induce the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators, including type I interferons (IFNs), which trigger and shape antiviral responses and protect cells from infection. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are amongst the first cells to encounter invading viruses and the ones producing type I IFNs. However, it is unclear whether IFNs act to prevent AMs from serving as vehicles for viral replication. In this study, primary AMs from MAVS (\emph{Mavs}\textsuperscript{-/-})- or type I IFN receptor (\emph{Ifnar1}\textsuperscript{-/-})-deficient mice were exposed to RSV ex vivo. Wild-type (wt) AMs but not \emph{Mavs}\textsuperscript{-/-} and \emph{Ifnar1}\textsuperscript{-/-} AMs produced inflammatory mediators in response to RSV. Furthermore, \emph{Mavs}\textsuperscript{-/-} and \emph{Ifnar1}\textsuperscript{-/-} AMs accumulated more RSV proteins than wt AMs, but the infection was abortive. Thus, RIG-I-like receptor-MAVS and IFNAR signalling are important for the induction of proinflammatory mediators from AMs upon RSV infection, but this signalling is not central for controlling viral replication. The ability to restrict viral replication makes AMs ideal sensors of RSV infection and important initiators of immune responses in the lung.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the cellular factors that play a role in the HIV replication cycle is fundamental to fully understanding mechanisms of viral replication and pathogenesis. Whole-genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens have identified positive and negative regulators of HIV replication, providing starting points for investigating new cellular factors. We report here that silencing of the deubiquitinase cylindromatosis protein (CYLD), increases HIV infection by enhancing HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription via the NF-κB pathway. CYLD is highly expressed in CD4+ T lymphocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and dendritic cells. We found that CYLD silencing increases HIV replication in T cell lines. We confirmed the positive role of CYLD silencing in HIV infection in primary human CD4+ T cells, in which CYLD protein was partially processed upon activation. Lastly, Jurkat T cells latently infected with HIV (JLat cells) were more responsive to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) reactivation in the absence of CYLD, indicating that CYLD activity could play a role in HIV reactivation from latency. In summary, we show that CYLD acts as a potent negative regulator of HIV mRNA expression by specifically inhibiting NF-κB-driven transcription. These findings suggest a function for this protein in modulating productive viral replication as well as in viral reactivation., IMPORTANCE HIV transcription is regulated by a number of host cell factors. Here we report that silencing of the lysine 63 deubiquitinase CYLD increases HIV transcription in an NF-κB-dependent manner. We show that CYLD is expressed in HIV target cells and that its silencing increases HIV infection in transformed T cell lines as well as primary CD4+ T cells. Similarly, reactivation of latent provirus was facilitated in the absence of CYLD. These data suggest that CYLD, which is highly expressed in CD4+ T cells, can control HIV transcription in productive infection as well as during reactivation from latency.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: Viral respiratory infections are increasingly implicated in allergic exacerbations. Virus-induced activation of eosinophils through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) could be involved. The present study was designed to examine TLR3 expression in eosinophils from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) during symptomatic allergic rhinitis, and to evaluate the functional responsiveness of TLR3 in purified eosinophils. METHODS: BM and PB samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis outside and during the pollen season. Eosinophils were analyzed for TLR3 expression by flow cytometry. Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], an agonist for TLR3, was used to assess its functional role in purified eosinophils and the intracellular signaling pathways involved. RESULTS: TLR3 expression was demonstrated in BM and PB eosinophils. It was higher in BM-derived than in circulating cells and it was downregulated in both compartments during symptomatic allergic rhinitis. TLR3 expression was also downregulated in the presence of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL- 5. Stimulation with poly(I:C) increased the percentage of CD11b+ cells and enhanced the secretion of IL-8, effects mediated via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathways. Moreover, pretreatment with IL-5 augmented the poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 release. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophils activated via TLR3 might be more able to home and recruit leukocytes to sites of inflammation. The decreased TLR3 expression during symptomatic allergic rhinitis and in the presence of Th2 cytokines indicates a role in allergic airway inflammation. Thus, eosinophils might function as a link between viral infections and exacerbations of allergic disease.},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Intense scientific effort to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in daunting numbers of genomic sequences. We witnessed evolutionary events that could mostly be inferred indirectly before, such as the emergence of variants with distinct phenotypes, for example transmissibility, severity and immune evasion. This Review explores the mechanisms that generate genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2, underlying the within-host and population-level processes that underpin these events. We examine the selective forces that likely drove the evolution of higher transmissibility and, in some cases, higher severity during the first year of the pandemic and the role of antigenic evolution during the second and third years, together with the implications of immune escape and reinfections, and the increasing evidence for and potential relevance of recombination. In order to understand how major lineages, such as variants of concern (VOCs), are generated, we contrast the evidence for the chronic infection model underlying the emergence of VOCs with the possibility of an animal reservoir playing a role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and conclude that the former is more likely. We evaluate uncertainties and outline scenarios for the possible future evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2.},

ARVs suppress viral activity in the host cell, thus minimizing injury to the cells and prolonging life. However, an effective treatment has remained elusive for four decades due to the successful immune evasion mechanisms of the virus. A thorough understanding of the molecular interaction of HIV with the host cell is essential in the development of both preventive and curative therapies for HIV infection. This review highlights several inherent mechanisms of HIV that promote its survival and propagation, such as the targeting of CD4+ lymphocytes, the downregulation of MHC class I and II, antigenic variation and an envelope complex that minimizes antibody access, and how they collaboratively render the immune system unable to mount an effective response.},

However, cellular and molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated pathology and immune defense features in different organs remains incomplete. Here, we profiled approximately 77\,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes of the lung, liver, kidney, and cerebral cortex in rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and healthy controls. Integrated analysis of the multi-organ dataset suggested that the liver harbored the strongest global transcriptional alterations. We observed prominent impairment in lung epithelial cells, especially in AT2 and ciliated cells, and evident signs of fibrosis in fibroblasts. These lung injury characteristics are similar to those reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, we found suppressed MHC class I/II molecular activity in the lung, inflammatory response in the liver, and activation of the kynurenine pathway, which induced the development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Analysis of the kidney dataset highlighted tropism of tubule cells to SARS-CoV-2, and we found membranous nephropathy (an autoimmune disease) caused by podocyte dysregulation. In addition, we identified the pathological states of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the cerebral cortex, providing molecular insights into COVID-19-related neurological implications.

To investigate the possibility of combining drug and immune-based selective pressures against HIV, we studied the effects of antiretroviral drug resistance mutations on CTL recognition of five HIV-1 Pol epitopes presented by common HLA molecules. We found that these common drug resistance mutations sustain or even enhance the antigenicity and immunogenicity of HIV-1 Pol CTL epitopes. Variable patterns of cross-reactive and selective recognition of wild-type and corresponding variant epitopes demonstrate a relatively diverse population of CD8(+) T cells reactive against these epitopes. Variant peptides with multiple drug resistance mutations still sustained CTL recognition, and some HIV-infected individuals demonstrated strong CD8(+) T cell responses against multiple CTL epitopes incorporating drug resistance mutations. Selective reactivity against variant peptides with drug resistance mutations reflected ongoing or previous exposure to the indicated drug, but was not dependent upon the predominance of the mutated sequence in endogenous virus. The frequency and diversity of CTL reactivity against the variant peptides incorporating drug resistance mutations and the ability of these peptides to activate and expand CTL precursors in vitro indicate a significant functional interface between the immune system and antiretroviral therapy. Thus, drug-resistant variants of HIV are susceptible to immune selective pressure that could be applied to combat transmission or emergence of antiretroviral drug-resistant HIV strains and to enhance the immune response against HIV.},

Agonist stimulation of TLR8 in cultured cortical neurons causes inhibition of neurite outgrowth and induces apoptosis in a dissociable manner. Our evidence indicates that such TLR8-mediated neuronal responses do not involve the canonical TLR–NF-κB signaling pathway.

  abstract = {COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterized by diverse clinical symptoms. Type I interferon (IFN-I) production is impaired and severe cases lead to ARDS and widespread coagulopathy. We propose that COVID-19 pathophysiology is initiated by SARS-CoV-2 gene products, the NSP1 and ORF6 proteins, leading to a catastrophic cascade of failures. These viral components induce signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) dysfunction and compensatory hyperactivation of STAT3. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, a positive feedback loop established between STAT3 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) may lead to an escalating cycle of activation in common with the interdependent signaling networks affected in COVID-19. Specifically, PAI-1 upregulation leads to coagulopathy characterized by intravascular thrombi. Overproduced PAI-1 binds to TLR4 on macrophages, inducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The recruitment and subsequent activation of innate immune cells within an infected lung drives the destruction of lung architecture, which leads to the infection of regional endothelial cells and produces a hypoxic environment that further stimulates PAI-1 production. Acute lung injury also activates EGFR and leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3. COVID-19 patients’ autopsies frequently exhibit diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and increased hyaluronan (HA) production which also leads to higher levels of PAI-1. COVID-19 risk factors are consistent with this scenario, as PAI-1 levels are increased in hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and old age. We discuss the possibility of using various approved drugs, or drugs currently in clinical development, to treat COVID-19. This perspective suggests to enhance STAT1 activity and/or inhibit STAT3 functions for COVID-19 treatment. This might derail the escalating STAT3/PAI-1 cycle central to COVID-19.},

However, the field lacks a consensus on analysis and result interpretation. Using whole-genome sequencing of multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia, we compare the performance of public signature analysis tools. We describe caveats and pitfalls of de novo signature extraction and fitting approaches, reporting on common inaccuracies: erroneous signature assignment, identification of localized hyper-mutational processes, overcalling of signatures. We provide reproducible solutions to solve these issues and use orthogonal approaches to validate our results. We show how a comprehensive mutational signature analysis may provide relevant biological insights, reporting evidence of c-AID activity among unmutated CLL cases or the absence of BRCA1/BRCA2-mediated homologous recombination deficiency in a MM cohort. Finally, we propose a general analysis framework to ensure production of accurate and reproducible mutational signature data.},

  abstract = {A proportion of the variation in HIV-1 viral load in the infected population is influenced by host genetics. Using a large sample of infected individuals (n = 6,315) with genome-wide genotype data, we sought to map genomic regions that influence HIV viral load and quantify their impact. We identified amino acid positions located in the binding groove of class I HLA proteins (HLA-A and -B) and SNPs in the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 gene region that together explain 14.5\% of the observed variation in HIV viral load. Controlling for these signals, we estimated that an additional 5.5\% can be explained by common, additive genetic variation. Thus, we demonstrate that common variants of large effect explain the majority of the host genetic component of HIV viral load., Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of HIV-1–infected populations have been underpowered to detect common variants with moderate impact on disease outcome and have not assessed the phenotypic variance explained by genome-wide additive effects. By combining the majority of available genome-wide genotyping data in HIV-infected populations, we tested for association between ∼8 million variants and viral load (HIV RNA copies per milliliter of plasma) in 6,315 individuals of European ancestry. The strongest signal of association was observed in the HLA class I region that was fully explained by independent effects mapping to five variable amino acid positions in the peptide binding grooves of the HLA-B and HLA-A proteins. We observed a second genome-wide significant association signal in the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor (CCR) gene cluster on chromosome 3. Conditional analysis showed that this signal could not be fully attributed to the known protective CCR5Δ32 allele and the risk P1 haplotype, suggesting further causal variants in this region. Heritability analysis demonstrated that common human genetic variation—mostly in the HLA and CCR5 regions—explains 25\% of the variability in viral load. This study suggests that analyses in non-European populations and of variant classes not assessed by GWAS should be priorities for the field going forward.},

A genetic case-control study was undertaken involving 30 cases of invasive vulvar cancer and its precursor lesion, high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), and 61 controls, matched for age and community of residence. It was hypothesized that this small, isolated population may exhibit increased autozygosity, implicating recessive effects as a possible mechanism for increased susceptibility to vulvar cancer. METHODS: Genotyping data from saliva samples were used to identify runs of homozygosity (ROH) in order to calculate estimates of genome-wide homozygosity. RESULTS: No evidence of an effect of genome-wide homozygosity on vulvar cancer and VIN in East Arnhem women was found, nor was any individual ROH found to be significantly associated with case status. This study found further evidence supporting an association between previous diagnosis of CIN and diagnosis of vulvar cancer or VIN, but found no association with any other medical history variable. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not eliminate the possibility of genetic risk factors being involved in this cancer cluster, but rather suggest that alternative analytical strategies and genetic models should be explored.},

  abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cells are important effectors of innate immunity playing a key role in the eradication and clearance of viral infections. Over the recent years, several studies have shown that HIV-1 pathologically changes NK cell homeostasis and hampers their antiviral effector functions. Moreover, high levels of chronic HIV-1 viremia markedly impair those NK cell regulatory features that normally regulate the cross talks between innate and adaptive immune responses. These pathogenic events take place early in the infection and are associated with a pathologic redistribution of NK cell subsets that includes the expansion of anergic CD56neg/CD16pos NK cells with an aberrant repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors. Nevertheless, the presence of specific haplotypes for NK cell receptors and the engagement of NK cell antibody-dependent cell cytotocity have been reported to control HIV-1 infection. This dichotomy can be extremely useful to both predict the clinical outcome of the infection and to develop alternative antiviral pharmacological approaches. Indeed, the administration of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected patients restores NK cell phenotype and functions to normal levels. Thus, antiretroviral therapy can help to develop NK cell-directed therapeutic strategies that include the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies and toll-like receptor agonists. The present review discusses how our current knowledge of NK cell pathophysiology in HIV-1 infection is being translated both in experimental and clinical trials aimed at controlling the infection and disease.},

Evasion of IFN-mediated antiviral signaling is a common defense strategy that pathogenic viruses use to replicate and propagate in their host. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 exerts this anti-IFN activity. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.},

Results: A total of 136 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered within the NFκB1 gene. Among them, 63 SNPs were significantly enriched in patients admitted in the ICU (p {$<$} 0.05) compared with the British Caucasian population in the 1000 Genomes study. These enriched SNPs are mainly intron variants, and only two are exon SNPs from the non-transcribing portion of the NFκB1 gene. Conclusions: Genetic variations in the NFκB1 gene could influence clinical outcomes of pandemic H1N1 infections. Our findings showed that sequence variations of the NFκB1 gene might influence patient response to influenza infection.},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ORF6 is an antagonist of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral signaling, achieved through the prevention of STAT1 nuclear localization. However, the exact mechanism through which ORF6 prevents STAT1 nuclear trafficking remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that ORF6 directly binds to STAT1 with or without IFN stimulation, resulting in the nuclear exclusion of STAT1. ORF6 also recognizes importin α subtypes with different modes, in particular, high affinity to importin α1 but a low affinity to importin α5. Although ORF6 potentially disrupts the importin α/importin β1-mediated nuclear transport, thereby suppressing the nuclear translocation of the other classical nuclear localization signal-containing cargo proteins, the inhibitory effect of ORF6 is modest when compared with that of STAT1. The results indicate that the drastic nuclear exclusion of STAT1 is attributed to the specific binding with ORF6, which is a distinct strategy for the importin α1-mediated pathway. Combined with the results from a newly-produced replicon system and a hamster model, we conclude that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 acts as a virulence factor via regulation of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to accelerate viral replication, resulting in disease progression.},

One such practice is gamification, introducing elements from games into the work environment with the purpose of improving employees’ affective experiences. Games have long been played at work, but they have emerged spontaneously from the employees themselves.  Here, we examine whether managerially-imposed games provide the desired benefits for affect and performance predicted by prior studies on games at work or whether they are a form of “mandatory fun.” We highlight the role of consent (Burawoy, 1979) as a psychological response to mandatory fun, which moderates these relationships and, in a field experiment, find that games, when consented to, increase positive affect at work, but, when consent is lacking, decrease positive affect.  In a follow up laboratory experiment, we also find that legitimation and a sense of individual agency are important sources of consent.},

To further characterize both the anti-HIV properties of IL-32 and the cytokine's relationship with host antiviral innate immune responses, we evaluated whether IL-32 can induce ex vivo the expression of antiviral IFN-induced genes (ISGs), namely myxovirus resistance A (MxA), and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic (APOBEC)3G and APOBEC3F. We also investigated whether in vivo IL-32 (α and nonα) mRNA levels were correlated with those of MxA and APOBEC3G/3F. Results indicated that IL-32 (α and nonα) mRNA levels were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected patients than in healthy individuals. Furthermore, IL-32 (α and nonα) mRNA levels correlated negatively with HIV RNA levels, but not with the CD4(+) T-cell count. Our ex vivo studies disclosed that ISGs mRNA levels were increased after IL-32γ treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interestingly, significant positive correlations were found between transcript levels of both IL-32α and IL-32nonα and those of MxA and APOBEC3G/3F in untreated chronically HIV-1-infected patients. Overall, our results demonstrated that IL-32 isoforms are highly expressed during chronic HIV-1 infection and that IL-32 could have a central role in the antiviral immune response against HIV-1.},

The presence of recessive loci is suggested for Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, their search has been poorly assessed to date. To investigate homozygosity in AD, here we performed a fine-scale ROH analysis using 10 independent cohorts of European ancestry (11,919 AD cases and 9181 controls.) We detected an increase of homozygosity in AD cases compared to controls [βAVROH (CI 95\%)\,=\,0.070 (0.037–0.104); P\,=\,3.91\,×\,10−5; βFROH (CI95\%)\,=\,0.043 (0.009–0.076); P\,=\,0.013]. ROHs increasing the risk of AD (OR\,{$>$}\,1) were significantly overrepresented compared to ROHs increasing protection (p\,{$<$}\,2.20\,×\,10−16). A significant ROH association with AD risk was detected upstream the HS3ST1 locus (chr4:11,189,482‒11,305,456), (β (CI 95\%)\,=\,1.09 (0.48 ‒ 1.48), p value\,=\,9.03\,×\,10−4), previously related to AD. Next, to search for recessive candidate variants in ROHs, we constructed a homozygosity map of inbred AD cases extracted from an outbred population and explored ROH regions in whole-exome sequencing data (N\,=\,1449). We detected a candidate marker, rs117458494, mapped in the SPON1 locus, which has been previously associated with amyloid metabolism. Here, we provide a research framework to look for recessive variants in AD using outbred populations. Our results showed that AD cases have enriched homozygosity, suggesting that recessive effects may explain a proportion of AD heritability.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTOver six billion people are expected to live in cities and surrounding regions by 2050. Consequently, in the near future, the autonomic and smart operation of cities may be a critical requirement to improve the economic, social, and environmental well-being of citizens. Smart urban technologies represent an important contribution to the sustainable development of cities, making smart cities a reality. In this sense, the energy sustainability of cities has become a global concern, bringing with it a wide range of research and technological challenges that affect many aspects of people's lives. Because most of the human lifetime is spent indoors, buildings, which make up a city subsystem, require special attention. Indeed, buildings are the cornerstone in terms of power consumption and CO2 emissions on a global scale. In this paper, we analyze the role that buildings play in terms of their energy performance at city level and present an energy-efficient management system integrated in a building automation platform based on an Internet of Things approach. Occupants play a crucial role in the system's operation to achieve energy efficient building performance, and any impact on self-sustainable smart cities will be a consequence of efficient user-centric smart building designs. Our proposal represents a user-centric smart solution as a contribution to the energy sustainability of modern cities. The building management platform has been deployed in a real (smart) building, in which a set of tests were carried out to assess different concerns involved in the building's infrastructure management. The first stages of this experiment have already resulted in an energy saving in heating of about 20\% at building level, which could translate into a reduction of 8\% in the energy consumption of buildings at a European city level.

Zidovudine 1500 mg/d was previously prescribed only to adult HIV-infected patients who had developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). However, results obtained from recently completed studies indicate that a lower daily dose (500 mg) appears to be equivalent. In addition, ZDV therapy appears to be beneficial to asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with CD4+ counts less than 500/mm3. The toxicity profile of ZDV, previously obtained from patients receiving 1500 mg/d, consisted of either acute (e.g., fever, rash, headache) or chronic (e.g., anemia, neutropenia, myopathy) adverse effects. ZDV pharmacokinetics are variable within and between the different subpopulations of HIV-infected patients who have been studied. Bioavailability ranges from 50 to 70 percent, and values for half-life, total body clearance, and volume of distribution are 1-2 h, 20-40 mL/min/kg, and 1-2 L/kg, respectively. Drug interactions occur primarily between ZDV and other agents that undergo hepatic glucuronidation (e.g., probenecid, sulfamethoxazole) resulting in decreased ZDV clearance. ZDV is currently measured by HPLC, radioimmunoassay and FPIA; however, the role of therapeutic monitoring is currently under investigation. Studies of ZDV therapy in neonates, pediatric patients, patients with resistant isolates of HIV, and HIV-infected patients receiving combined treatment with other reverse transcriptase inhibitors or immunomodulators are ongoing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV-1 protease is subjected to dual selection pressure exerted by protease inhibitors (PIs) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Recently, we identified KMIGGIGGF (KF9) as a HLA-B*1501-restricted CTL epitope, including several major PI resistance mutations (M46I/L, I47A/V, G48V, I50V). To assess potential interactions between KF9-specific CTL and emergence of these important resistance mutations, we studied CTL recognition of the mutations and analyzed protease sequences in an HLA-I–typed patient cohort. METHODS: CTL recognition of KF9 and resistance mutations in KF9 were studied in 38 HLA-B*1501-positive HIV-1–infected patients using variant KF9 peptides in interferon-g enzyme-linked immunospot assays. Protease sequences were analyzed in 302 HLA-I–typed HIV-1–infected patients. RESULTS: G48V abolished KF9 recognition by CTL in all patients. Furthermore, M46I, I47A, and I50V could impair or abolish CTL recognition in many patients. In contrast, M46L and I47V showed good CTL recognition in nearly all patients. HIV-1 protease sequence analysis showed no statistical correlation between the occurrence of resistance mutations in KF9 and HLA-B*1501. Viral load in patients failing therapy with KF9 mutations was significantly lower in HLA-B*1501-positive patients in comparison with HLA-B*1501-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: PI mutations, G48V, M46I, and I47A, can abrogate CTL recognition, indicating potential interactions between development of drug resistance and CTL response. However, we could not find evidence that development of these PI mutations is influenced by KF9-specific CTL.},

  abstract = {Background: The effects of silent mutations on pre-mRNA splicing are poorly understood., Results: Silent mutations can significantly influence exon inclusion and are under purifying selection., Conclusion: Splicing and coding pressures have co-evolved to maintain sufficient exon inclusion levels., Significance: Modified species alignment approaches can be used to identify silent mutations that may alter exon inclusion., Alternative splicing diversifies mRNA transcripts in human cells. This sequence-driven process can be influenced greatly by mutations, even those that do not change the protein coding potential of the transcript. Synonymous mutations have been shown to alter gene expression through modulation of splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. Using a synonymous position mutation library in SMN1 exon 7, we show that 23\% of synonymous mutations across the exon decrease exon inclusion, suggesting that nucleotide identity across the entire exon has been evolutionarily optimized to support a particular exon inclusion level. Although phylogenetic conservation scores are insufficient to identify synonymous positions important for exon inclusion, an alignment of organisms filtered based on similar exon/intron architecture is highly successful. Although many of the splicing neutral mutations are observed to occur, none of the exon inclusion reducing mutants was found in the filtered alignment. Using the modified phylogenetic comparison as an approach to evaluate the impact on pre-mRNA splicing suggests that up to 45\% of synonymous SNPs are likely to alter pre-mRNA splicing. These results demonstrate that coding and pre-mRNA splicing pressures co-evolve and that a modified phylogenetic comparison based on the exon/intron architecture is a useful tool in identifying splice altering SNPs.},

Recent studies have suggested a mechanism of innate immune-induced neuronal apoptosis through the stimulation of endosomal TLRs in neurons. TLRs are stimulated both by pathogen-associated molecular patterns as well as by damage-associated molecular patterns, including microRNAs released by damaged neurons. In the present study, we identified the mechanism responsible for TLR7/TLR9-mediated neuronal apoptosis. TLR-induced apoptosis required endosomal localization of TLRs but was independent of MyD88 signaling. Instead, apoptosis required the TLR adaptor molecule SARM1, which localized to the mitochondria following TLR activation and was associated with mitochondrial accumulation in neurites. Deficiency in SARM1 inhibited both mitochondrial accumulation in neurites and TLR-induced apoptosis. These studies identify a non-MyD88 pathway of TLR7/ TLR9 signaling in neurons and provide a mechanism for how innate immune responses in the CNS directly induce neuronal damage.},

While the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not completely understood, there appears to be a wide spectrum of disease ranging from mild symptoms to severe respiratory distress, hospitalization, and mortality. There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for COVID-19 aside from remdesivir; early efforts to identify efficacious therapeutics for COVID-19 have mainly focused on drug repurposing screens to identify compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cellular infection systems. These screens have yielded intriguing hits, but the use of nonhuman immortalized cell lines derived from non-pulmonary or gastrointestinal origins poses any number of questions in predicting the physiological and pathological relevance of these potential interventions. While our knowledge of this novel virus continues to evolve, our current understanding of the key molecular and cellular interactions involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection is discussed in order to provide a framework for developing the most appropriate in vitro toolbox to support current and future drug discovery efforts.},

  abstract = {Understanding viral tropism is an essential step toward reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, decreasing mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and limiting opportunities for mutant strains to arise. Currently, little is known about the extent to which distinct tissue sites in the human head and neck region and proximal respiratory tract selectively permit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. In this translational study, we discover key variabilities in expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), essential SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, among the mucosal tissues of the human proximal airways. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is present in all examined head and neck tissues, with a notable tropism for the nasal cavity and tracheal mucosa. Finally, we uncover an association between smoking and higher SARS-CoV-2 viral infection in the human proximal airway, which may explain the increased susceptibility of smokers to developing severe COVID-19. This is at least partially explained by differences in interferon (IFN)-β1 levels between smokers and non-smokers.,                                        •               ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are variably expressed among mucosal surfaces of the head and neck                                         •               Enriched TMPRSS2 expression may drive SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the nasal cavity and trachea                                         •               SARS-CoV-2 preferentially replicates in the nasal cavity and trachea of individuals with COVID-19                                         •               Smoking is associated with increased proximal airway SARS-CoV-2, in part because of IFN-β1                                 , Nakayama et~al. discover key variabilities in expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors among human head and neck mucosal tissues.

  abstract = {The sudden emergence of severe respiratory disease, caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently become a public health emergency. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed its close resemblance to the earlier reported SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, initial testing of the drugs used against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been ineffective in controlling SARS-CoV-2. The present study highlights the genomic, proteomic, pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have carried out sequence analysis of potential drug target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and, compared them with SARS-CoV and MERS viruses. Analysis of mutations in the coding and non-coding regions, genetic diversity, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 has also been done. A detailed structural analysis of drug target proteins has been performed to gain insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis, structure-function relationships, and the development of structure-guided therapeutic approaches. The cytokine profiling and inflammatory signalling are different in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also highlighted possible therapies and their mechanism of action followed by clinical manifestation.

  abstract = {Runs of homozygosity (ROH) segments, contiguous homozygous regions in a genome were traditionally linked to families and inbred populations. However, a growing literature suggests that ROHs are ubiquitous in outbred populations. Still, most existing genetic studies of ROH in populations are limited to aggregated ROH content across the genome, which does not offer the resolution for mapping causal loci. This limitation is mainly due to a lack of methods for efficient identification of shared ROH diplotypes. Here, we present a new method, ROH-DICE, to find large ROH diplotype clusters, sufficiently long ROHs shared by a sufficient number of individuals, in large cohorts. ROH-DICE identified over 1 million ROH diplotypes that span over 100 SNPs and shared by more than 100 UK Biobank participants. Moreover, we found significant associations of clustered ROH diplotypes across the genome with various self-reported diseases, with the strongest associations found between the extended HLA region and autoimmune disorders. We found an association between a diplotype covering the HFE gene and haemochromatosis, even though the well-known causal SNP was not directly genotyped nor imputed. Using genome-wide scan, we identified a putative association between carriers of an ROH diplotype in chromosome 4 and an increase of mortality among COVID-19 patients. In summary, our ROH-DICE method, by calling out large ROH diplotypes in a large outbred population, enables further population genetics into the demographic history of large populations. More importantly, our method enables a new genome-wide mapping approach for finding disease-causing loci with multi-marker recessive effects at population scale.},

  abstract = {Genome sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is increasingly important to monitor the transmission and adaptive evolution of the virus. The accessibility of high-throughput methods and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has facilitated a growing ecosystem of protocols. Two differing protocols are tiling multiplex PCR and bait capture enrichment. Each method has advantages and disadvantages but a direct comparison with different viral RNA concentrations has not been performed to assess the performance of these approaches. Here we compare Liverpool amplification, ARTIC amplification, and bait capture using clinical diagnostics samples. All libraries were sequenced using an Illumina MiniSeq with data analyzed using a standardized bioinformatics workflow (SARS-CoV-2 Illumina GeNome Assembly Line; SIGNAL). One sample showed poor SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage and consensus, reflective of low viral RNA concentration. In contrast, the second sample had a higher viral RNA concentration, which yielded good genome coverage and consensus. ARTIC amplification showed the highest depth of coverage results for both samples, suggesting this protocol is effective for low concentrations. Liverpool amplification provided a more even read coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, but at a lower depth of coverage. Bait capture enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA provided results on par with amplification. While only two clinical samples were examined in this comparative analysis, both the Liverpool and ARTIC amplification methods showed differing efficacy for high and low concentration samples. In addition, amplification-free bait capture enriched sequencing of cDNA is a viable method for generating a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and for identification of amplification artifacts.},

  abstract = {The proinflammatory cytokine IL-32 is elevated in the plasma and tissues of HIV-1–infected individuals. However, its significance in HIV-1 infection remains unclear because IL-32 inhibits and stimulates viral production in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and CD4+ T cells, respectively. In this study, we initially found that the inhibitory effect on human MDMs depends on SAMHD1, a dNTP triphosphohydrolase that inhibits viral reverse transcription. IL-32 increased the unphosphorylated active form of SAMHD1, which was consistent with the reduced expression of the upstream cyclin-dependent kinases. Indeed, IL-32 lost its anti–HIV-1 activity in MDMs when SAMHD1 was depleted. These results explain why IL-32 inhibits HIV-1 in MDMs but not CD4+ T cells, because SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 in noncycling MDMs but not in cycling CD4+ T cells. Another unique feature of IL-32 is the induction of the immunosuppressive molecule IDO1, which is beneficial for HIV-1 infection. In this study, we found that IL-32 also upregulates other immunosuppressive molecules, including PD-L1, in MDMs. Moreover, IL-32 promoted the motility of MDMs, which potentially facilitates intercellular HIV-1 transmission. Our findings indicate that IL-32 has both the direct inhibitory effect on HIV-1 production in MDMs and the indirect stimulatory effects through phenotypic modulation of MDMs, and they suggest that the stimulatory effects may outweigh the inhibitory effect because the window for IL-32 to inhibit HIV-1 is relatively confined to SAMHD1-mediated reverse transcription suppression in the viral life cycle.}

Depression, anxiety disorders, and disorders related to substance abuse were identified as key role-players influencing adherence. The severity of symptoms related to these disorders was found to be inversely related to ART adherence, with the possible exception of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD was found to have both positive and negative implications for adherence, with severity of symptoms ranging from health-protective concern to disabling distress. Possible solutions aimed at addressing the adverse effects of mental health problems on adherence are discussed. Routine screening in ART settings is suggested in settings where follow-up of positive screen scores are possible, along with the necessary interventions to resolve the disorder of concern. Suggested interventions include utilising psychotherapeutic treatment, both in isolation and in conjunction with medication, to address mental health problems. Furthermore, finding effective ways of marshalling social support is recommended for ensuring optimal adherence, and possibly mitigating the adverse effects of mental health problems. Further research is needed to find feasible ways of identifying, assessing and treating patients with mental health problems in resource-constrained settings where HIV prevalence is highest.},

Descriptive statistics are used to characterize the purpose and timing of trips, and multivariate analyses of peak versus non-peak departure-time models offers insights into the differences and similarities across cohorts. Findings suggest that the timing of travel, along with reasons for travel, are broadly similar across the generations.},

This work reviews the use of gamification-based teaching during the pandemic lockdown through a search in Scopus, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Semantic Scholar databases. A total of 11 papers from Chemistry, Business, Computer Science, Biology, and Medical areas have been identified and included in the present work. All of them analyzed the use of gamification strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed student’s learning and motivation outcomes. In general, students reported that gamification was innovative, engaging, and an efficient strategy to deliver curricula material; moreover, it was perceived as a fun activity. Some students reported that gamified videoconferences aided to connect with their classmates during isolation time providing effective social support. However, some students reported a bad physical or psychological condition, as consequence of the confinement, and did not get involved in the activity. Some weaknesses of the reviewed studies are the small sample size and its homogeneity, which makes it difficult to generalize their results to other scenarios and academic areas. Furthermore, although there is a feeling of learning during the activity, this result is mainly based on subjective perceptions, and any of the studies demonstrated that superior learning was achieved in comparison with traditional teaching strategies. Nevertheless, gamification can be implemented together with traditional lectures and can be a valuable instrument during post-COVID times.},

We found a strong association of two psoriasis MHC variants, rs9264942 and rs3021366, with both HIV-1 controller status and viral load, and identified another Class III MHC variant rs9368699 to be strongly associated with viral load. A number of genetic variants outside the MHC (SOX5, TLR9, SDC4, PROX1, IL12B, TLR4, MBL-2, TYK2, IFIH1) demonstrated nominal significance. Overall, our data suggest that several psoriasis variants within the MHC have a robust impact on HIV-1 control, while variants outside the MHC require further investigation.},

Therefore, the identification and analysis of this kind of polymorphisms in the human genome has gained high importance in the research community, and an increasing number of studies have been published during the last years. As a consequence of this exhaustive exploration, an association between the presence of some specific SNPs and the susceptibility or severity of many infectious diseases in some risk population groups has been found.

  abstract = {This study presents basic concepts and applications of Artificial Intelligence System (AIS) for development of intelligent transport systems in smart cities in India. With growing urbanization the government has now realized the need for developing smart cities that can cope with the challenges of urban living and also be magnets for investment in India. Transport system in smart cities should be accessible, safe, environmentally friendly, faster, comfortable and affordable without compromising the future needs. The Indian cities largely lacks of Intelligent Transport System in India and there are various problems such as inefficient public transport system, severe congestion, increasing incidence of road accidents, inadequate parking spaces and a rapidly increasing energy cost etc. Therefore, development of Intelligent Transportation System is essential for smart cities due to concerns regarding the environmental, economic, and social equity. Artificial Intelligence is a key technology to resolve these issues. Therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt Artificial Intelligence system for development of Intelligent Transport System to better understand and control its operations in smart cities.

  abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, which is thought to result from the effect of environmental factors in a genetically predisposed host. A gene location in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16, IBD1, that contributes to susceptibility to Crohn's disease has been established through multiple linkage studies1,2,3,4,5,6, but the specific gene(s) has not been identified. NOD2, a gene that encodes a protein with homology to plant disease resistance gene products is located in the peak region of linkage on chromosome 16 (ref. 7). Here we show, by using the transmission disequilibium test and case-control analysis, that a frameshift mutation caused by a cytosine insertion, 3020insC, which is expected to encode a truncated NOD2 protein, is associated with Crohn's disease. Wild-type NOD2 activates nuclear factor NF-κB, making it responsive to bacterial lipopolysaccharides; however, this induction was deficient in mutant NOD2. These results implicate NOD2 in susceptibility to Crohn's disease, and suggest a link between an innate immune response to bacterial components and development of disease.},

Inactivation of {$>$}100 genes—including Pbrm1, Arid2, and Brd7, which encode components of the PBAF form of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex—sensitized mouse B16F10 melanoma cells to killing by T cells. Loss of PBAF function increased tumor cell sensitivity to interferon-γ, resulting in enhanced secretion of chemokines that recruit effector T cells. Treatment-resistant tumors became responsive to immunotherapy when Pbrm1 was inactivated. In many human cancers, expression of PBRM1 and ARID2 inversely correlated with expression of T cell cytotoxicity genes, and Pbrm1-deficient murine melanomas were more strongly infiltrated by cytotoxic T cells.},

Diverse mechanisms have been proposed and studies reported conflicting results. Moreover, renal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 does not equate to its renal pathogenicity. For a virus to be pathogenic, in addition to its affinity (tropism) for specific tissue(s), host cells must allow viral entry, and discuss the important role played by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and coexpression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the same cells is important to cause damage. Lack of coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the same cells of the kidneys is the limiting factor of SARS-CoV-2 direct effects in the kidney. We present the rationale and cumulative evidence supporting that AKI is secondary to hemodynamic and immunologic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the direct injury or infection.},

  abstract = {Over the past thirty years, the world’s patent systems have experienced pressure from civil society like never before. From farmers to patient advocates, new voices are arguing that patents impact public health, economic inequality, morality—and democracy. These challenges, to domains that we usually consider technical and legal, may seem surprising. But in Patent Politics, Shobita Parthasarathy argues that patent systems have always been deeply political and social. ~ To demonstrate this, Parthasarathy takes readers through a particularly fierce and prolonged set of controversies over patents on life forms linked to important advances in biology and agriculture and potentially life-saving medicines. Comparing battles over patents on animals, human embryonic stem cells, human genes, and plants in the United States and Europe, she shows how political culture, ideology, and history shape patent system politics. Clashes over whose voices and which values matter in the patent system, as well as what counts as knowledge and whose expertise is important, look quite different in these two places. And through these debates, the United States and Europe are developing very different approaches to patent and innovation governance. Not just the first comprehensive look at the controversies swirling around biotechnology patents, Patent Politics is also the first in-depth analysis of the political underpinnings and implications of modern patent systems, and provides a timely analysis of how we can reform these systems around the world to maximize the public interest.},

  abstract = {This review presents a broader approach to the implementation and study of runs of homozygosity (ROH) in animal populations, focusing on identifying and characterizing ROH and their practical implications. ROH are continuous homozygous segments that are common in individuals and populations. The ability of these homozygous segments to give insight into a population's genetic events makes them a useful tool that can provide information about the demographic evolution of a population over time. Furthermore, ROH provide useful information about the genetic relatedness among individuals, helping to minimize the inbreeding rate and also helping to expose deleterious variants in the genome. The frequency, size and distribution of ROH in the genome are influenced by factors such as natural and artificial selection, recombination, linkage disequilibrium, population structure, mutation rate and inbreeding level. Calculating the inbreeding coefficient from molecular information from ROH (FROH ) is more accurate for estimating autozygosity and for detecting both~past and more recent inbreeding effects than are estimates from pedigree data (FPED ). The better results of FROH suggest that FROH can be used to infer information about the history and inbreeding levels of a population in the absence of genealogical information. The selection of superior animals has produced large phenotypic changes and has reshaped the ROH patterns in various regions of the genome. Additionally, selection increases homozygosity around the target locus, and deleterious variants are seen to occur more frequently in ROH regions. Studies involving ROH are increasingly common and provide valuable information about how the genome's architecture can disclose a population's genetic background. By revealing the molecular changes in populations over time, genome-wide information is crucial to understanding antecedent genome architecture and, therefore, to maintaining diversity and fitness in endangered livestock breeds.},

Recent findings~           Current HIV treatment is started as soon as feasible in a person with HIV infection and consists of a three-drug oral daily antiretroviral regimen, consisting of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors combined with a third drug, either an integrase inhibitor, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or a protease inhibitor. Present treatment regimens are potent, convenient, generally well tolerated and durable, and lead to a normal life expectancy. Present antiretroviral-based HIV prevention strategies focus on treating people with HIV infection with antiretrovirals as soon as feasible to reduce their risk of transmitting to others, and providing two-drug pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and three-drug post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to those HIV-uninfected individuals who are at risk for HIV infection. PrEP is highly effective when used correctly. Further data on early antiretroviral therapy and PrEP are needed to demonstrate any impact on HIV epidemic control.           Summary~           HIV treatment and HIV prevention have improved markedly in recent years due to the development of oral antiretrovirals that are potent, convenient, and generally well tolerated, and lead to virologic suppression and decreased HIV transmission.},

  abstract = {The immune system struggles every day between responding to foreign antigens and tolerating self-antigens to delicately maintain tissue homeostasis. If self-tolerance is broken, the development of autoimmunity can be the consequence, as it is in the case of the chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is considered to be a multifactorial disease comprising various processes and cell types that act abnormally and in a harmful way. Oxidative stress, infections, or, in general, tissue injury are accompanied by massive cellular demise. Several processes such as apoptosis, necrosis, or NETosis (formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps [NETs]) may occur alone or in combination. If clearance of dead cells is insufficient, cellular debris may accumulate and trigger inflammation and leakage of cytoplasmic and nuclear autoantigens like ribonucleoproteins, DNA, or histones. Inadequate removal of cellular remnants in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs may result in the presentation of autoantigens by follicular dendritic cells to autoreactive B cells that had been generated by chance during the process of somatic hypermutation (loss of peripheral tolerance). The improper exposure of nuclear autoantigens in this delicate location is consequently prone to break self-tolerance to nuclear autoantigens. Indeed, the germline variants of autoantibodies often do not show autoreactivity. The subsequent production of autoantibodies plays a critical role in the development of the complex immunological disorder fostering SLE. Immune complexes composed of cell-derived autoantigens and autoantibodies are formed and get deposited in various tissues, such as the kidney, leading to severe organ damage. Alternatively, they may also be formed in situ by binding to planted antigens of circulating autoantibodies. Here, we review current knowledge about the etiopathogenesis of SLE including the involvement of different types of cell death, serving as the potential source of autoantigens, and impaired clearance of cell remnants, causing accumulation of cellular debris.},

The human APOBEC gene clusters arose on chromosome 6 and 22 through gene duplication and divergence to where current day APOBEC proteins are functionally diverse and broadly expressed in tissues. APOBEC serve enzymatic and non enzymatic functions in cells. In both cases, formation of higher-order structures driven by APOBEC protein-protein interactions and binding to RNA and/or single stranded DNA are integral to their function. In some circumstances, these interactions are regulatory and modulate APOBEC activities. We are just beginning to understand how macromolecular interactions drive processes such as APOBEC subcellular compartmentalization, formation of holoenzyme complexes, gene targeting, foreign DNA restriction, anti-retroviral activity, formation of ribonucleoprotein particles and APOBEC degradation. Protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid cross-linking methods coupled with mass spectrometry, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, glycerol gradient sedimentation, fluorescence anisotropy and APOBEC deaminase assays are enabling mapping of interacting surfaces that are essential for these functions. The goal of this methods review is through example of our research on APOBEC3G, describe the application of cross-linking methods to characterize and quantify macromolecular interactions and their functional implications. Given the homology in structure and function, it is proposed that these methods will be generally applicable to the discovery process for other APOBEC and RNA and DNA editing and modifying proteins.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) reported by several epidemiological studies is inconsistent. This meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the survival rate from HIV diagnosis to AIDS onset and from AIDS onset to death. METHODS: The electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus were searched to February 2016. In addition, the reference lists of included studies were checked to identify further references, and the database of the International AIDS Society was also searched. Cohort studies addressing the survival rate in patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS were included in this meta-analysis. The outcomes of interest were the survival rate of patients diagnosed with HIV progressing to AIDS, and the survival rate of patients with AIDS dying from AIDS-related causes with or without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The survival rate (P) was estimated with 95\% confidence intervals based on random-effects models. RESULTS: In total, 27,862 references were identified, and 57 studies involving 294,662 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Two, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-year survival probabilities of progression from HIV diagnosis to AIDS onset were estimated to be 82\%, 72\%, 64\%, 57\%, 26\% and 19\%, respectively. Two, 4-, 6-, 8- and 10-year survival probabilities of progression from AIDS onset to AIDS-related death in patients who received HAART were estimated to be 87\%, 86\%, 78\%, 78\%, and 61\%, respectively, and 2-, 4- and 6-year survival probabilities of progression from AIDS onset to AIDS-related death in patients who did not receive HAART were estimated to be 48\%, 26\% and 18\%, respectively. Evidence of considerable heterogeneity was found. The majority of the studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: The majority of HIV-positive patients progress to AIDS within the first decade of diagnosis. Most patients who receive HAART will survive for {$>$}10~years after the onset of AIDS, whereas the majority of the patients who do not receive HAART die within 2~years of the onset of AIDS.},

  abstract = {HIVAN1, HIVAN2, and HIVAN3 are nephropathy-susceptibility loci previously identified in the HIV-1 transgenic mouse, a model of collapsing glomerulopathy. The HIVAN1 and HIVAN2 loci modulate expression of Nphs2, which encodes podocin and several other podocyte-expressed genes. To identify additional loci predisposing to nephropathy, we performed a genome-wide scan in 165 backcross mice generated between the nephropathy-sensitive HIV-1-transgenic FVB/NJ (TgFVB) strain and the resistant Balb/cJ (BALB) strain. We identified a major susceptibility locus (HIVAN4) on chromosome 6 G3-F3, with BALB alleles conferring a twofold reduction in severity (peak LOD score = 4.0). Similar to HIVAN1 and HIVAN2, HIVAN4 modulated expression of Nphs2, indicating a common pathway underlying these loci. We independently confirmed the HIVAN4 locus in a sister TgFVB colony that experienced a dramatic loss of nephropathy subsequent to a breeding bottleneck. In this low-penetrance line, 3\% of the genome was admixed with BALB alleles, suggesting a remote contamination event. The admixture localized to discrete segments on chromosome 2 and at the HIVAN4 locus. HIVAN4 candidate genes include killer lectin-like receptor genes as well as A2m and Ptpro, whose gene products are enriched in the glomerulus and interact with HIV-1 proteins. In summary, these data identify HIVAN4 as a major quantitative trait locus for nephropathy and a transregulator of Nphs2. Furthermore, similar selective breeding strategies may help identify further susceptibility loci.},

We find that proteasomal activity generates multiple length variants of KK10 (4-14 amino acids), which bind TAP and HLA-B∗27:05. However, only epitope forms ≥8 amino acids evoke peptide length-specific and cross-reactive CTL responses. Structural analyses reveal that all epitope forms bind HLA-B∗27:05 via a conserved N-terminal motif, and competition experiments show that the truncated epitope forms outcompete immunogenic epitope forms for binding to HLA-B∗27:05. Common viral escape mutations abolish (L136M) or impair (R132K) production of KK10 and longer epitope forms. Peptide length influences how well the inhibitory NK cell receptor KIR3DL1 binds HLA-B∗27:05 peptide complexes and how intraepitope mutations affect this interaction. These results identify a viral escape mechanism from CTL and NK responses based on differential antigen processing and peptide competition.},

Therefore, studying the viral susceptibility of other organs is important for a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the receptor protein of SARS-CoV-2, and TMPRSS2 promotes virus proliferation and transmission. We investigated the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels of cell types from 31 organs to evaluate the risk of viral infection using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. For the first time, we found that the gall bladder and fallopian tube are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, the nose, heart, small intestine, large intestine, esophagus, brain, testis, and kidney are also identified to be high-risk organs with high expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Moreover, the susceptible organs are grouped into three risk levels based on the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. As a result, the respiratory system, digestive system, and urinary system are at the top-risk level for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study provides evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human nervous system, digestive system, reproductive system, respiratory system, circulatory system, and urinary system using scRNA-seq data, which helps in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Recognition of double-stranded RNA by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) will increase the production of cytokines and chemokines through transcriptional activation by the NF-κB protein. Over 136 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR3 have been identified in the human population. Of these, four alter the sequence of the TLR3 protein. Molecular modeling suggests that two of the SNPs, N284I and L412F, could affect the packing of the leucine-rich repeating units in TLR3. Notably, L412F is reported to be present in 20\% of the population and is higher in the asthmatic population. To examine whether the four SNPs affect TLR3 function, each were cloned and tested for their ability to activate the expression of TLR3-dependent reporter constructs. SNP N284I was nearly completely defective for activating reporter activity, and L412F was reduced in activity. These two SNPs did not obviously affect the level of TLR3 expression or their intracellular location in vesicles. However, N284I and L412F were underrepresented on the cell surface, as determined by flow cytometry analysis, and were not efficiently secreted into the culture medium when expressed as the soluble ectodomain. They were also reduced in their ability to act in a dominant negative fashion on the wild type TLR3 allele.

  abstract = {There are still many unanswered questions concerning viral SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in COVID-19. Accessory proteins in SARS-CoV-2 consist of eleven viral proteins whose roles during infection are still not completely understood. Here, a review on the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins is summarized updating new research that could be critical in understanding SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the host. Some accessory proteins such as ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF8 have been shown to be important IFN-I antagonists inducing an impairment in the host immune response. In addition, ORF3a is involved in apoptosis whereas others like ORF9b and ORF9c interact with cellular organelles leading to suppression of the antiviral response in infected cells. However, possible roles of ORF7b and ORF10 are still awaiting to be described. Also, ORF3d has been reassigned. Relevant information on the knowns and the unknowns in these proteins is analyzed, which could be crucial for further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and to design strategies counteracting their actions evading immune responses in COVID-19.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) prevalence increased during the initial years of the antiretroviral therapy (ART) global scale-up. Few studies have examined recent trends in TDR prevalence using published genetic sequences and described the characteristics of ART-naïve persons from whom these published sequences have been obtained. METHODS: We identified 125 studies published between 2014 and 2019 for which HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) with or without protease from ≥50 ART-naïve adult persons were submitted to the GenBank sequence database. The population characteristics and TDR prevalence were compared to those in 122 studies published in the preceding five years between 2009 and 2013. TDR prevalence was analysed using median study-level and person-level data. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The 2009 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 studies reported sequence data from 32,866 and 41,724 ART-naïve persons respectively. Studies from the low- and middle-income country (LMIC) regions in sub-Saharan Africa, South/Southeast Asia and Latin America/Caribbean accounted for approximately two-thirds of the studies during each period. Between the two periods, the proportion of studies from sub-Saharan Africa and from South/Southeast Asia countries other than China decreased from 43\% to 32\% and the proportion of studies performed at sentinel sites for recent HIV-1 infection decreased from 33\% to 22\%. Between 2014 and 2019, median study-level TDR prevalence was 4.1\% in South/Southeast Asia, 6.0\% in sub-Saharan Africa, 9.1\% in Latin America/Caribbean, 8.5\% in Europe and 14.2\% in North America. In the person-level analysis, there was an increase in overall, NNRTI and two-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance in sub-Saharan Africa; an increase in NNRTI resistance in Latin America/Caribbean, and an increase in overall, NNRTI and PI resistance in North America. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, NNRTI and dual NRTI/NNRTI-associated TDR prevalence was significantly higher in sub-Saharan Africa studies published between 2014 and 2019 compared with those published between 2009 and 2013. The decreasing proportion of studies from the hardest hit LMIC regions and the shift away from sentinel sites for recent infection suggests that global TDR surveillance efforts and publication of findings require renewed emphasis.},

PLWH underwent from suffering severe disease and often fatal complications at young ages to having a chronic condition and a life expectancy close to the general population. Nevertheless, chronic age-related diseases increase as PLWH age. The harmful effect of HIV infection on the individual's immune system adds to its deterioration during ageing, exacerbating comorbidities. In addition, PLWH are more exposed to risk factors affecting ageing, such as coinfections or harmful lifestyles. The ART initiation reverses the biological ageing process but only partially, and additionally can have some toxicities that influence ageing. Observational studies suggest premature ageing in PLWH. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the early prediction of unhealthy ageing through validated biomarkers, easy to implement in HIV-clinical settings. The most promising biomarkers are second-generation epigenetic clocks and integrative algorithms.},

  abstract = {To identify novel host factors as putative targets to reverse HIV-1 latency, we performed an insertional mutagenesis genetic screen in a latent HIV-1 infected pseudohaploid KBM7 cell line (Hap-Lat). Following mutagenesis, insertions were mapped to the genome, and bioinformatic analysis resulted in the identification of 69 candidate host genes involved in maintaining HIV-1 latency. A select set of candidate genes was functionally validated using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion in latent HIV-1 infected J-Lat A2 and 11.1 T cell lines. We confirmed ADK, CHD9, CMSS1, EVI2B, EXOSC8, FAM19A, GRIK5, IRF2BP2, NF1, and USP15 as novel host factors involved in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that CHD9, a chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein, maintains HIV-1 latency via direct association with the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), and its depletion results in increased histone acetylation at the HIV-1 promoter, concomitant with HIV-1 latency reversal. FDA-approved inhibitors 5-iodotubercidin, trametinib, and topiramate, targeting ADK, NF1, and GRIK5, respectively, were characterized for their latency reversal potential. While 5-iodotubercidin exhibited significant cytotoxicity in both J-Lat and primary CD4+ T cells, trametinib reversed latency in J-Lat cells but not in latent HIV-1 infected primary CD4+ T cells. Importantly, topiramate reversed latency in cell line models, in latently infected primary CD4+ T cells, and crucially in CD4+ T cells from three people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) under suppressive antiretroviral therapy, without inducing T cell activation or significant toxicity. Thus, using an adaptation of a haploid forward genetic screen, we identified novel and druggable host factors contributing to HIV-1 latency. IMPORTANCE A reservoir of latent HIV-1 infected cells persists in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), representing a major obstacle for viral eradication. Reactivation of the latent HIV-1 provirus is part of curative strategies which aim to promote clearance of the infected cells. Using a two-color haploid screen, we identified 69 candidate genes as latency-maintaining host factors and functionally validated a subset of 10 of those in additional T-cell-based cell line models of HIV-1 latency. We further demonstrated that CHD9 is associated with HIV-1's promoter, the 5' LTR, while this association is lost upon reactivation. Additionally, we characterized the latency reversal potential of FDA compounds targeting ADK, NF1, and GRIK5 and identify the GRIK5 inhibitor topiramate as a viable latency reversal agent with clinical potential.},

All such aspects and the heterogeneity of different IoT components (e.g., network interfaces, communication protocols, data structure, and data semantics) have caused interoperability issues which might hamper the effectiveness of support decision systems for smart cities, where the use of big data and machine learning techniques has been considered, in addition to the exploration of smart city data. This article proposes an environment IoT-based platform for smart cities that grants interoperability from data capture to knowledge extraction and visualization through the use of Semantic Web Technologies and the definition of an ontology for environment indicators. The components of the platform include IoT devices, gateways, cloud, and fog computing, which are used for a better application of big data techniques. A real environment quality monitoring use case was considered for the validation of the platform. Metrics, such as latency and resources consumption, were analyzed for three communication protocols, namely, MQTT, CoAP, and REST. CoAP adapter provided the best results regarding latency, RAM, and CPU consumption.},

The aim was to identify possible tissue-specific patterns and signatures of variant selection for each respiratory compartment. Six patients, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, were included in the study. Thirteen URT and LRT were analyzed by NGS amplicon-based approach on Ion Torrent Platform. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using both realized in-house and supplied by ThermoFisher programs. Phylogenesis showed clade V clustering of the first patients diagnosed in Italy, and clade G for later strains. The presence of quasispecies was observed, with variants uniformly distributed along the genome and frequency of minority variants spanning from 1\% to \textasciitilde 30\%. For each patient, the patterns of variants in URT and LRT were profoundly different, indicating compartmentalized virus replication. No clear variant signature and no significant difference in nucleotide diversity between LRT and URT were observed. SARS-CoV-2 presents genetic heterogeneity and quasispecies compartmentalization in URT and LRT. Intra-patient diversity was low. The pattern of minority variants was highly heterogeneous and no specific district signature could be identified, nevertheless, analysis of samples, longitudinally collected in patients, supported quasispecies evolution.},

The core regions vary in composition from 10:0 to 0:10 in the ratio of alanine to leucine residues. Thus, a nonfunctional polyalanine-containing signal peptide is titrated with the more hydrophobic residue, leucine. Analysis of this series identified a midpoint for rapid precursor processing between alanine to leucine ratios of 6:4 and 5:5 [Doud et al. (1993): Biochemistry 32:1251-1256]. Examination of precursors that are processed more slowly indicates a lower limit of signal peptide hydrophobicity that permits membrane association and translocation. Analysis of precursors that are processed rapidly defines an intermediate range of hydrophobicity that is optimum; above this level precursors become insensitive to transport inhibitors such as sodium azide and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) in parallel with substantial inhibition of beta-lactamase processing. Our data indicate that there is a surprisingly narrow range of signal peptide hydrophobicity which both supports transport of the protein to which it is attached and which does not have such a high affinity for the transport pathway that it disrupts the appropriate balance of other secreted proteins.},

Here we show that information encoded in the hydrophobic domain of a signal sequence influences the timing and efficiency of at least two steps in maturation, namely \emph{N}-linked glycosylation and signal sequence cleavage. We demonstrate that these consequences correlate with and likely stem from the nature of the initial association made between the signal sequence and the translocon during the initiation of translocation. We propose a model by which these maturational events are controlled by the signal sequence-translocon interaction.

  abstract = {Structural characteristics are essential for the functioning of many noncoding RNAs and cis-regulatory elements of mRNAs. SNPs may disrupt these structures, interfere with their molecular function, and hence cause a phenotypic effect. RNA folding algorithms can provide detailed insights into structural effects of SNPs. The global measures employed so far suffer from limited accuracy of folding programs on large RNAs and are computationally too demanding for genome-wide applications. Here, we present a strategy that focuses on the local regions of maximal structural change between mutant and wild-type. These local regions are approximated in a “screening mode” that is intended for genome-wide applications. Furthermore, localized regions are identified as those with maximal discrepancy. The mutation effects are quantified in terms of empirical P values. To this end, the RNAsnp software uses extensive precomputed tables of the distribution of SNP effects as function of length and GC content. RNAsnp thus achieves both a noise reduction and speed-up of several orders of magnitude over shuffling-based approaches. On a data set comprising 501 SNPs associated with human-inherited diseases, we predict 54 to have significant local structural effect in the untranslated region of mRNAs.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other mutations may disrupt the RNA structure, interfere with the molecular function and hence cause a phenotypic effect. RNAsnp is an efficient method to predict the effect of SNPs on local RNA secondary structure based on the RNA folding algorithms implemented in the Vienna RNA package. The SNP effects are quantified in terms of empirical P-values, which, for computational efficiency, are derived from extensive pre-computed tables of distributions of substitution effects as a function of gene length and GC content. Here, we present a web service that not only provides an interface for RNAsnp but also features a graphical output representation. In addition, the web server is connected to a local mirror of the UCSC genome browser database that enables the users to select the genomic sequences for analysis and visualize the results directly in the UCSC genome browser.

Here, we performed comprehensive analysis of in-house sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome mutations dynamics in the patients infected with the VOCs - Delta and Omicron, within Recovered and Mortality patients. Statistical analysis highlighted significant mutations - T4685A, N4992N, and G5063S in RdRp; T19R in NTD spike; K444N and N532H in RBD spike, associated with Delta mortality. Mutations, T19I in NTD spike, Q493R and N440K in the RBD spike were significantly associated with Omicron mortality. We performed molecular docking for possible effect of significant mutations on the binding of Remdesivir. We found that Remdesivir showed less binding efficacy with the mutant Spike protein of both Delta and Omicron mortality compared to recovered patients. This indicates that mortality associated mutations could have a modulatory effect on drug binding which could be associated with disease outcome., Fig. 1: Summary of the possible functional role of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, mutations, and drug efficacy; with modulatory role in disease severity and clinical outcome.

  abstract = {The main aim of gamification, i.e. the implementation of game design elements in real-world contexts for non-gaming purposes, is to foster human motivation and performance in regard to a given activity. Previous research, although not entirely conclusive, generally supports the hypothesis underlying this aim. However, previous studies have often treated gamification as a generic construct, neglecting the fact that there are many different game design elements which can result in very diverse applications. Based on a self-determination theory framework, we present the results of a randomized controlled study that used an online simulation environment. We deliberately varied different configurations of game design elements, and analysed them in regard to their effect on the fulfilment of basic psychological needs. Our results show that badges, leaderboards, and performance graphs positively affect competence need satisfaction, as well as perceived task meaningfulness, while avatars, meaningful stories, and teammates affect experiences of social relatedness. Perceived decision freedom, however, could not be affected as intended. We interpret these findings as general support for our main hypothesis that gamification is not effective per se, but that specific game design elements have specific psychological effects. Consequences for further research, in particular the importance of treatment checks, are discussed.},

In this manuscript, we present genotypeR, a package that implements a common genotyping workflow with a standardized software interface. The genotypeR package is written in r with integration of a marker design pipeline written in Perl. genotypeR designs SNP genotyping markers from vcf files produced from variant calling of sequence data. These markers are processed before genotyping to ensure that they can be used in downstream analyses. After marker multiplexing suitability has been conducted on the genotyping platform, genotyping is conducted and raw output from the genotyping assay is processed by genotypeR. The primary post-genotyping functionality includes commonly used QA/QC procedures, genotype conversions, recombination analysis and data export to a popular program that uses genotyping data (rqtl). genotypeR provides a unified software environment for analysing SNP genotyping data, and will be useful for researchers investigating various research questions, removing the need for individual researchers to write custom software, and facilitating a common workflow.},

The performance requirements for visualization and analysis tools delivering these data are increasing rapidly. Significant progress in developing online, web-native three-dimensional (3D) visualization tools was previously accomplished with the introduction of the LiteMol suite and NGL Viewers. Thereafter, Mol* development was jointly initiated by PDBe and RCSB PDB to combine and build on the strengths of LiteMol (developed by PDBe) and NGL (developed by RCSB PDB). The web-native Mol* Viewer enables 3D visualization and streaming of macromolecular coordinate and experimental data, together with capabilities for displaying structure quality, functional, or biological context annotations. High-performance graphics and data management allows users to simultaneously visualise up to hundreds of (superimposed) protein structures, stream molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, render cell-level models, or display huge I/HM structures. It is the primary 3D structure viewer used by PDBe and RCSB PDB. It can be easily integrated into third-party services. Mol* Viewer is open source and freely available at https://molstar.org/.},

  abstract = {Dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viral infections trigger high patient morbidity and mortality. Mono-/co-infection of these viruses activates innate immune response, triggering Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. The present study investigated the differential role of TLR3, 7 and 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between mono- and co-infected Eastern Indian patients. Interaction of TLR polymorphic variants with signal peptidase complex (SPC18) was explored which might affect immune signalling against DENV/CHIKV infections. Out of 550 febrile symptomatic patients, 128 DENV-CHIKV co-infected samples were genotyped for eight SNPs of TLR3 (rs3775290-chr4:186083063), TLR7 (rs179008-chrX:12885540, rs5741880-chrX:12869297, rs179010-chrX:12884766, rs3853839-chrX:12889539) and TLR8 (rs5744080-chrX:12919685, rs3764879-chrX:12906578, rs3764880-chrX:12906707) by PCR-RFLP along with 157 healthy individuals. Statistical analysis established genotypic association of TLR SNPs with DENV-CHIKV co-infection, and difference between mono- and co-infected patients and their role in determining high viral load (HVL) during competitive viral replication among co-infected patients. In silico protein-protein docking evaluated interactive effect of TLR variants with SPC18. The findings revealed patients with CC genotypes of TLR7 and 8 SNPs were significantly susceptible towards co-infection, whereas specific genotypes of TLR7 and 8 imparted protection against co-infection. Differential analysis between mono-/co-infected patients revealed distinct genotypic distribution of TLR3, 7 and 8 SNPs. Co-infected patients with TT-rs179010 exhibited DENV-HVL, whereas CHIKV-HVL was detected among patients with other genotypes. Molecular docking of TLR7-rs179008 Q variant and TLR8-rs3764880 V variant with SPC18 generated better free binding energy. This study underlined the importance of TLR7 and 8 SNPs towards mono-/co-infection of DENV/CHIKV, with certain genotypes associated with co-infection susceptibility. Moreover, it suggested a probable role of specific genotypes of TLR7 and 8 polymorphisms imparting high dengue/chikungunya viral load among co-infected patients.},

CD46 genetic variants are associated with susceptibility to several infectious and autoimmune diseases.

We sought to determine the association between CD46 gene variants and HIV-1 acquired through intravenous drug use (IDU) and sexual routes (n = 823). Study subjects were of European ancestry and were HIV-1 infected (n = 438) or exposed but seronegative (n = 387). Genotyping of the rs2796265 SNP located in the CD46 gene region was done by allele-specific real-time PCR. A meta-analysis merging IDU and sexual cohorts indicates that the minor genotype (CC) was associated with increased resistance to HIV-1 infection OR = 0.2, 95\% CI (0.07–0.61), p = 0.004. The HIV-1-protective genotype is correlated with reduced CD46 expression and alterations in the ratio of CD46 mRNA splicing isoforms.},

Here, we describe the origins and evolution of these viruses, and the circumstances that led to the AIDS pandemic. Both HIVs are the result of multiple cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) naturally infecting African primates. Most of these transfers resulted in viruses that spread in humans to only a limited extent. However, one transmission event, involving SIVcpz from chimpanzees in southeastern Cameroon, gave rise to HIV-1 group M—the principal cause of the AIDS pandemic. We discuss how host restriction factors have shaped the emergence of new SIV zoonoses by imposing adaptive hurdles to cross-species transmission and/or secondary spread. We also show that AIDS has likely afflicted chimpanzees long before the emergence of HIV. Tracing the genetic changes that occurred as SIVs crossed from monkeys to apes and from apes to humans provides a new framework to examine the requirements of successful host switches and to gauge future zoonotic risk., Approximately one century ago in southeastern Cameroon, cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees gave rise to HIV-1 group M, the principal cause of the AIDS pandemic in humans.},

Previous findings that duplicated Toll-like receptor 7 (Tlr7) promotes lupus-like disease in male BXSB mice prompted us to evaluate TLR7 in human SLE. By using a candidate gene approach, we identified and replicated association of a TLR7 3′UTR SNP, rs3853839 (G/C), with SLE in 9,274 Eastern Asians (Pcombined = 6.5 × 10−10), with a stronger effect in male than female subjects [odds ratio, male vs. female = 2.33 (95\% CI = 1.64–3.30) vs. 1.24 (95\% CI = 1.14–1.34); P = 4.1 × 10−4]. G-allele carriers had increased TLR7 transcripts and more pronounced IFN signature than C-allele carriers; heterozygotes had 2.7-fold higher transcripts of G-allele than C-allele. These data established a functional polymorphism in type I IFN pathway gene TLR7 predisposing to SLE, especially in Chinese and Japanese male subjects.},

  abstract = {During the last decade the field of cancer immunotherapy has witnessed impressive progress. Highly effective immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibition, and T-cell engaging therapies like bispecific T-cell engaging (BiTE) single-chain antibody constructs and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown remarkable efficacy in clinical trials and some of these agents have already received regulatory approval. However, along with growing experience in the clinical application of these potent immunotherapeutic agents comes the increasing awareness of their inherent and potentially fatal adverse effects, most notably the cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying CRS pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, differential diagnoses, and prognostic factors. In addition, based on the current evidence we give practical guidance to the management of the cytokine release syndrome.},

  abstract = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a fatal complication of influenza infection. In this Review we provide an integrated model for its pathogenesis. ARDS involves damage to the epithelial–endothelial barrier, fluid leakage into the alveolar lumen, and respiratory insufficiency. The most important part of the epithelial–endothelial barrier is the alveolar epithelium, strengthened by tight junctions. Influenza virus targets these epithelial cells, reducing sodium pump activity, damaging tight junctions, and killing infected cells. Infected epithelial cells produce cytokines that attract leucocytes—neutrophils and macrophages—and activate adjacent endothelial cells. Activated endothelial cells and infiltrated leucocytes stimulate further infiltration, and leucocytes induce production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide that damage the barrier. Activated macrophages also cause direct apoptosis of epithelial cells. This model for influenza-induced ARDS differs from the classic model, which is centred on endothelial damage, and provides a rationale for therapeutic intervention to moderate host response in influenza-induced ARDS.},

  abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with widespread inflammation, immune dysregulation, and is associated with the generation of destructive anti-DNA autoantibodies. We have shown previously the immune modulatory properties of pCons peptide in the induction of both CD4+ and CD8+ regulatory T cells which can in turn suppress development of the autoimmune disease in (NZB/NZW) F1 (BWF1) mice, an established model of lupus. In the present study, we add novel protein information and further demonstrate the molecular and cellular phenotypes of pCons-induced CD4+ and CD8+ Treg subsets. Flow cytometry analyses revealed that pCons induced CD8+ Treg cells with the following cell surface molecules: CD25highCD28high and low subsets (shown earlier), CD62Lhigh, CD122low, PD1low, CTLA4low, CCR7low and 41BBhigh. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) gene expression analyses revealed that pCons-induced CD8+ Treg cells downregulated the following several genes: Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS2), RGS16, RGS17, BAX, GPT2, PDE3b, GADD45β and programmed cell death 1 (PD1). Further, we confirmed the down regulation of these genes by Western blot analyses at the protein level. To our translational significance, we showed herein that pCons significantly increased the percentage of CD8+FoxP3+ T cells and further increased the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of FoxP3 when healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are treated with pCons (10 μg/ml, for 24-48 hours). In addition, we found that pCons reduced apoptosis in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B220+ B cells of BWF1 lupus mice. These data suggest that pCons stimulates cellular, immunological, and molecular changes in regulatory T cells which in turn protect against SLE autoimmunity.},

The burden of infectious diseases including COVID-19 are generally reported to be higher for the Indigenous people. The historical knowledge have also suggested that the indigenous populations suffer more than the general populations in the pandemic. Recently, it has been reported that the indigenous groups of Brazil have been massively affected by COVID-19. Series of studies have shown that many of the indigenous communities reached at the verge of extinction due to this pandemic. Importantly, South Asia also has several indigenous and smaller communities, that are living in isolation. Till date, despite the two consecutive waves in India, there is no report on the impact of COVID-19 for indigenous tribes. Since smaller populations experiencing drift may have greater risk of such pandemic, we have analysed Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) among South Asian populations and identified several populations with longer homozygous segments. The longer runs of homozygosity at certain genomic regions may increases the susceptibility for COVID-19. Thus, we suggest extreme careful management of this pandemic among isolated populations of South Asia.},

We evaluate genetic variation in TLR2 (6 SNPs), TLR3 (4 SNPs), and TLR4 (8 SNPs) with risk of developing colon or rectal cancer and survival after diagnosis., TLR3 rs11721827 was associated with rectal cancer (OR 1.27 95\% CI 1.02,1.58 for AC/CC vs AA genotype Wald p 0.035; adjusted p 0.126); TLR3 rs3775292 and TLR4 rs11536898 were associated with colon cancer (OR 0.68 95\% CI 0.49,0.95 for GG vs CC/CG and OR 0.50 95\% CI 0.29,0.87 for AA vs. CA/CC respectively; Wald p=0.023 and 0.015; adjusted p=0.085 and 0.101 respectively).

  abstract = {Human capital development, attractions of sustainable living standards and renewed concerns for the planet have redirected city planners to a new frontier: the creation of sustainable cities. This is evident in some initiatives taken to create cities with low to zero carbon emissions, build sustainable structures and create higher institutions of learning where sustainability practices are entrenched in their curricula. Examples of the forerunners of sustainable cities are abound; from the Middle East (Education City in Qatar and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi) to Far East (Dongtan Institute in China and New Songdo City in South Korea), new cities imbued with sustainability practices are springing forth. There are 400 big cities and 23 mega cities presently occupying the world urban spaces, with estimates of about one and 10 million inhabitants, respectively. Ironically cities occupy about 2\% of the earth surface, they however consume 60–80\% of global energy. The global urban population rose from 220 million to about 2.8 billion in the 20th century, and it is projected that by 2050, this will increase to 6.9 billion, which is about 70\% of the world population. Therefore, sustainability campaigns, when directed at cities, would have intended impacts due to a number of factors associated with cities: large population, hub of intellectual and social integration, high consumption, etc. In creating modern sustainable cities however, the attention of cities' planners and policymakers alike should be on those goals that come under the banner of sustainability, especially when designing new or retrofitting existing human settlements (the cities); such as human capital development, energy conservation and energy efficiency, water security, efficient use of earth-abundant resources, transportation, building standards, social and economic equity, and food wastes management. Although there are few review articles in the literature that separately deal with individual sustainability fundamentals, there is a dearth of publication consolidating key sustainability principles required for modern cities. This paper reviewed each element needed to make a functional sustainable city. We adopted a simple approach; we explained each sustainability principle, highlighted its core values and gave reasons why it is an important candidate to be considered in making a working city. We critiqued the current sustainable cities by stating reasons for their strengths and explanations for their deficiencies. We engaged the future sustainable cities’ planners to learn from the failures of some of the earlier hurriedly executed sustainable cities in order to have the most important elements of sustainability present in their future project execution.},

  abstract = {Achieving sustainability goals is complex and requires policy coherence; yet effective action for structural change has been elusive partly because global issues must be primarily addressed locally. Agreements such as the UN Global Goals and the New Urban Agenda and current pressing problems such as the 2020 pandemic demonstrate that it is impossible to tackle global socio-ecological system issues without addressing urban vulnerabilities and consumption models. This article presents a critical review of theoretical roots, conceptual influences, major debates, limitations, and current trends in community and urban sustainability. Broader sustainability theories and intellectual traditions of the last two centuries have shaped current urban agendas, most of which however do not cater to a systemic approach and may lead to policies that do not integrate all three pillars of sustainability. While cities are challenged by the difficulties of addressing multiple objectives, meaningfully engaging citizens, and consistently tracking progress, the limitations of urban sustainability application can lead to lost opportunities, lack of credibility, and increased public skepticism. Fundamental changes are required in local decision-making and citizen mobilization to move from current piecemeal approaches towards long-lasting urban sustainability and successful implementation of global goals.},

METHODS: We first generated F1 hybrids between HIV-1 transgenic mice on the FVB/NJ background and 20 inbred laboratory strains. Analysis of histology, BUN, and urinary NGAL demonstrated marked phenotypic variation among the transgenic F1 hybrids, providing strong evidence for host genetic factors in the predisposition to nephropathy. A GWAS in 365 transgenic F1 hybrids generated from these 20 inbred strains was performed. RESULTS: We identified a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 13-C3 and multiple additional suggestive loci. Crossannotation of the Chr. 13 locus, including single-cell transcriptomic analysis of wildtype and HIV-1 transgenic mouse kidneys, nominated Ssbp2 as the most likely candidate gene. Ssbp2 is highly expressed in podocytes, encodes a transcriptional cofactor that interacts with LDB1 and LMX1B, which are both previously implicated in FSGS. Consistent with these data, older Ssbp2 null mice spontaneously develop glomerulosclerosis, tubular casts, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation, similar to the HIVAN mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the utility of GWAS in mice to uncover host genetic factors for rare kidney traits and suggest Ssbp2 as susceptibility gene for HIVAN, potentially acting via the LDB1-LMX1B transcriptional network.},

To define host genetic effects on the outcome of a chronic viral infection, we performed genome-wide association analysis in a multiethnic cohort of HIV-1 controllers and progressors, and we analyzed the effects of individual amino acids within the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins. We identified {$>$} 300 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MHC and none elsewhere. Specific amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove, as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explain the SNP associations and reconcile both protective and risk HLA alíeles.

  abstract = {Intracellular Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and activates antiviral immune responses through the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines. This receptor binds to dsRNA molecules produced during human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. TLR7 senses viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in endosomes, and it can interact with endogenous RNAs. We determined the genotype distribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TLR3 and TLR7 genes in children with HCMV infection and the relationship between TLR polymorphisms and viral infection. We genotyped 59 children with symptomatic HCMV infection and 78 healthy individuals for SNPs in the TLR3 (rs3775290, c.1377C{$>$}T, F459F; rs3775291, c.1234C{$>$}T, L412F; rs3775296, c.-7C{$>$}A) and TLR7 (rs179008, c.32A{$>$}T, Q11L; rs5741880, c.3+1716G{$>$}T) genes. SNP genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and capillary electrophoresis. The HCMV DNA load was quantified by real-time PCR. We found an increased frequency of the heterozygous genotype TLR3 L412F in children with HCMV infection compared with uninfected cases. In individuals with a mutation present in at least one allele of the L412F SNP, an increased risk of HCMV disease was found, and this result remained highly significant after Bonferroni’s correction for multiple testing (Pc {$<$} 0.001). The heterozygous genotype of this SNP was associated with the increased risk of HCMV disease in an adjusted model that included the HCMV DNA copy number in whole blood and urine (P {$<$} 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively). Moreover, those with a heterozygous genotype of rs3775296 showed an increased relative risk of HCMV infection (P = 0.042), but this association did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple testing. In contrast, the rs3775290 SNP of TLR3 and TLR7 SNPs were not related to viral infection. A moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed between the SNPs rs3775291 and rs3775296 (r2 = 0.514). We suggest that the L412F polymorphism in the TLR3 gene could be a genetic risk factor for the development of HCMV disease.},

  abstract = {In the past decades a number of software programs have been developed to infer phylogenetic relationships between populations. However, most of these programs typically use alignments of sequences from genes to build phylogeny. Recently, many standalone or web applications have been developed to handle large-scale whole genome data, but they are either computationally intensive, dependent on third party software or required significant time and resource of a web server. In the post-genomic era, researchers are able to obtain bioinformatically processed high-quality publication-ready whole genome data for many individuals in a population from next generation sequencing companies due to the reduction in the cost of sequencing and analysis. Such genotype data is typically presented in the Variant Call Format (VCF) and there is no simple software available that directly uses this data format to construct the phylogeny of populations in a short time. To address this limitation, we have developed a user-friendly software, VCF2PopTree that uses genome-wide SNPs to construct and display phylogenetic trees in seconds to minutes. For example, it reads a VCF file containing 4 million SNPs and draws a tree in less than 30 seconds. VCF2PopTree accepts genotype data from a local machine, constructs a tree using UPGMA and Neighbour-Joining algorithms and displays it on a web-browser. It also produces pairwise-diversity matrix in MEGA and PHYLIP file formats as well as trees in the Newick format which could be directly used by other popular phylogenetic software programs. The software including the source code, a test VCF file and a documentation are available at: https://github.com/sansubs/vcf2pop.},

The quasi-experimental research method comprised the scales for measuring intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, student engagement, and attention, as well as an open-ended questionnaire to collect quantitative and qualitative data for analysis. The study involved 144 seventh-grade students who were divided into three groups to learn English using different polling tools. The results indicated that when the gamified IRS was used for polling activities in the classroom, the fun, interactive, competitive, and novel nature of the system helped improve the students’ levels of intrinsic motivation, overall engagement, emotional engagement, and focused attention. The use of clickers for polling leads to significant intrinsic motivation compared to using small whiteboards. This study suggests integrating the gamification element with classroom teaching to make English classes more interesting and attractive to learners. In addition, tools that are highly interactive, challenging, and competitive make students pay more attention in the classroom, and so are more helpful to them when learning English.},

We aimed to explore the association of TLRs single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and COPD risk.,  Methods: 170 COPD patients and 181 healthy controls were enrolled in this case-control study. MassARRAY platform was used for genotyping seven tagging SNPs (TLR2: rs3804100, rs4696480, rs3804099; TLR3: rs3775290, rs3775291, rs5743305; TLR9: rs352140) of TLRs. The correlations between the SNPs and COPD risk were determined using logistic regression.,  Results: We found that the rs3775291 of TLR3 significant decreased the risk of COPD (TT versus CC: non-adjusted OR = 0.329, 95\% CI = 0.123–0.879, p = 0.027). In the genetic models analysis, the rs3775291 was associated with a decreased effect of COPD based on the recessive model (TT versus CC/CT: non-adjusted OR = 0.377, 95\% CI = 0.144–0.988~p = 0.047). The rs4696480 of TLR2 gene was associated with a decreased risk of COPD after adjustment by age and gender (TA versus AA: adjusted OR = 0.606, 95\% CI = 0.376–0.975, p = 0.039).,  Conclusion: Our study showed that genetic variants in TLRs were associated with risk of COPD. The rs3775291 and rs4696480 may act as a potential biomarker for predicting the risk of COPD in Chinese population.},

We then crossed the RNase Tg to TLR7 Tg mice to create TLR7 × RNase double Tg (DTg) mice. DTg mice had a significantly increased survival associated with reduced activation of T and B lymphocytes and reduced kidney deposition of IgG and C3. We observed massive hepatic inflammation and cell death in TLR7 Tg mice. In contrast, hepatic inflammation and necrosis were strikingly reduced in DTg mice. These findings indicate that high concentrations of serum RNase protect against immune activation and inflammation associated with TLR7 stimulation and that RNase may be a useful therapeutic strategy in the prevention or treatment of inflammation in systemic lupus erythematosus and, possibly, liver diseases.},

Here we used a single-cell, next-generation sequencing approach for the direct ex vivo phenotypic profiling of individual HIV-1-infected memory CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and lymph nodes of people living with HIV-1 and receiving antiretroviral treatment for approximately 10 years. We demonstrate that in peripheral blood, cells harbouring genome-intact proviruses and large clones of virally infected cells frequently express ensemble signatures of surface markers conferring increased resistance to immune-mediated killing by cytotoxic T and natural killer cells, paired with elevated levels of expression of immune checkpoint markers likely to limit proviral gene transcription; this phenotypic profile might reduce HIV-1 reservoir cell exposure to and killing by cellular host immune responses. Viral reservoir cells harbouring intact HIV-1 from lymph nodes exhibited a phenotypic signature primarily characterized by upregulation of surface markers promoting cell survival, including CD44, CD28, CD127 and the IL-21 receptor. Together, these results suggest compartmentalized phenotypic signatures of immune selection in HIV-1 reservoir cells, implying that only small subsets of infected cells with optimal adaptation to their anatomical immune microenvironment are able to survive during long-term antiretroviral treatment. The identification of phenotypic markers distinguishing viral reservoir cells may inform future approaches for strategies to cure and eradicate HIV-1., A proteogenomic profiling analysis of single cells from the blood and lymph nodes of individuals living with HIV-1 reveals that CD4+ memory T cells harbouring intact provirus show signatures associated with~resistance to immune-mediated killing and cell survival.},

Missense mutations altering the binding of ligands to proteins are one of the critical mechanisms that result in genetic disease and drug resistance. Computational methods have made a lot of progress for predicting binding affinity changes and identifying resistance mutations, but their prediction accuracy and speed are still not satisfied and need to be further improved. To address these issues, we introduce a structure-based machine learning method for quantitatively estimating the effects of single mutations on ligand binding affinity changes (named as PremPLI). A comprehensive comparison of the predictive performance of PremPLI with other available methods on two benchmark datasets confirms that our approach performs robustly and presents similar or even higher predictive accuracy than the approaches relying on first-principle statistical mechanics and mixed physics- and knowledge-based potentials while requires much less computational resources. PremPLI can be used for guiding the design of ligand-binding proteins, identifying and understanding disease driver mutations, and finding potential resistance mutations for different drugs. PremPLI is freely available at https://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPLI/and allows to do large-scale mutational scanning.},

To study the quasispecies features and the intra-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2, we collected nine confirmed patients and sequenced the haplotypes of spike gene using a single-molecule real-time platform. Fourteen samples were extracted from sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or stool, which in total produced 283,655 high-quality circular consensus sequences. We observed a stable quasispecies structure that one master mutant (mean abundance ∼0.70), followed by numerous minor mutants (mean abundance ∼1.21\,×\,10-3). Under high selective pressure, minor mutants may obtain a fitness advantage and become the master ones. The later predominant substitution D614G existed in the minor mutants of more than one early patient. An epidemic variant had a possibility to be independently originated from multiple hosts. The mutant spectrums covered ∼85\% amino acid variations of public genomes (GISAID; frequency\,≥\,0.1) and likely provided an advantage mutation pool for the current/future epidemic variants. Notably, 32 of 35 collected antibody escape substitutions were preexistent in the early quasispecies. Virus populations in different tissues/organs revealed potentially independent replications. The quasispecies complexity of sputum samples was significantly lower than that of nasopharyngeal swabs (P\,=\,0.02). Evolution analysis revealed that three continuous S2 domains (HR1, CH, and CD) had undergone a positive selection. Cell fusion-related domains may play a crucial role in adapting to the intrahost immune system. Our findings suggested that future epidemiologic investigations and clinical interventions should consider the quasispecies information that has missed by routine single consensus genome. IMPORTANCE RNA virus population in a host does not consist of a consensus single haplotype but rather an ensemble of related sequences termed quasispecies. The dynamics of quasispecies afford SARS-CoV-2 a great ability on genetic fitness during intrahost evolution. The process is likely achieved by changing the genetic characteristics of key functional genes, such as the spike glycoprotein. Previous studies have applied the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to evaluate the quasispecies of SARS-CoV-2, and results indicated a low genetic diversity of the spike gene. However, the NGS platform cannot directly obtain the full haplotypes without assembling, and it is also difficult to predict the extremely low-frequency variations. Therefore, we introduced a single-molecule real-time technology to directly obtain the haplotypes of the RNA population and further study the quasispecies features and intrahost evolution of the spike gene.},

  abstract = {Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), a member of the pathogen recognition receptors, is widely expressed in various cells and has been shown to activate immune signaling pathways by recognizing viral double-stranded RNA. Recently, it was reported that the activation of TLR3 induced apoptosis in some cells, but the detailed molecular mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we found that in endothelial cells polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I-C)) induced dose- and time-dependent cell apoptosis, which was elicited by TLR3 activation, as TLR3 neutralization and down-regulation repressed the apoptosis. Poly(I-C) induced the activation of both caspases 8 and 9, indicating that TLR3 triggered the signaling of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Poly(I-C) up-regulated tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and its receptors, death receptors 4/5, resulting in initiating the extrinsic pathway. Furthermore, poly(I-C) down-regulated anti-apoptotic protein, B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and up-regulated Noxa, a key Bcl-2 homology 3-only antagonist of Bcl-2, leading to the priming of the intrinsic pathway. A p53-related protein, the transactivating p63 isoform α (TAp63α), was induced by TLR3 activation and contributed to the activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Both the cells deficient in p63 gene expression by RNA interference and cells that overexpressed the N-terminally truncated p63 isoform α (ΔNp63α), a dominant-negative variant of TAp63α, by gene transfection, survived TLR3 activation. Taken together, TAp63α is a crucial regulator downstream of TLR3 to induce cell death via death receptors and mitochondria.},

Monkeys were infected experimentally with SIV containing difficult-to-revert mutations in nef that selectively eliminated MHC downregulation but not these other activities. Monkeys infected with these mutant forms of SIV exhibited higher levels of CD8+ T-cell responses 4 to 16 weeks postinfection than seen in monkeys infected with the parental wild-type virus. Furthermore, unusual compensatory mutations appeared by 16 to 32 weeks postinfection which restored some or all of the MHC-downregulating activity. These results indicate that nef does serve to limit the virus-specific CD8 cellular response of the host and that the ability to downregulate MHC class I contributes importantly to the totality of nef function.},

It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a prototypical cytokine with functional pleiotropy and plays an important role in host defense. When infections or tissue injuries occur, IL-6 is promptly produced by monocytes and macrophages and contributes to removal of infectious agents and restoration of damaged tissues through activation of immune, hematological, and acute-phase responses. Once stress is removed from the host, IL-6 synthesis ends, but uncontrolled excessive or persistent IL-6 production plays a pathological role in the development of various inflammatory diseases and cancers, indicating that IL-6 is a double-edged sword for the host. Thus, the proper IL-6 expression is very important for host defense and is strictly controlled by chromatin structure, transcriptional regulation, and posttranscriptional modification. Differentiation status of cells, various transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and microRNAs are involved in this process. Since it is assumed that dysregulation of any of these regulatory molecules may cause abnormal IL-6 expression in a particular disease, further elucidation of the factors and processes involved in IL-6 expression can be expected to facilitate to clarification of pathogenesis and to identification of novel target molecule(s) for specific diseases.},

Smart card systems in many cities, however, record only the bus boarding information (namely an open system), which makes it challenging to use smart card data for origin-destination estimations and subsequent analyses. This study addresses this research gap by proposing a machine learning approach and applying the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to estimate the alighting stops of bus trips from open smart card data. It advances the state-of-the-art by including, for the first time, weather variables and travel history of individuals in the GBDT algorithm alongside the network characteristics. The method is applied to six-month smart card data from the City of Changsha, China, with more than 17 million trip-records from 700 thousand card users. The model prediction results show that, compared to classic machine learning methods, GBDT not only yields higher prediction accuracy but more importantly is also able to rank the influencing factors on bus ridership. The results demonstrate that incorporation of weather variables and travel history further improves the prediction capability of the models. The proposed GBDT-based framework is flexible and scalable: it can be readily trained with smart card data from other cities to be used for predicting bus origin-destination flow. The results can contribute to improved transport sustainability of a city by enabling smart bus planning and operational decisions.},

Most cancer predisposition genes identified through GWASs function in a co-dominant manner, and studies have not found evidence for recessively functioning disease loci in TC. Our study examines whether homozygosity is associated with an increased risk of TC and searches for novel recessively acting disease loci. METHODS: Data from a previously conducted GWAS were used for the estimation of the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by all common SNPs, the detection of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and the determination of inbreeding to unravel their influence on TC. RESULTS: Inbreeding coefficients were significantly higher among cases than controls. Association on a SNP-by-SNP basis was controlled by using the false discovery rate at a level of q*\,{$<$} 0.05, with 34 SNPs representing true differences in homozygosity between cases and controls. The average size, the number and total length of ROHs per person were significantly higher in cases than in controls. A total of 16 recurrent ROHs of rather short length were identified although their association with TC risk was not significant at a genome-wide level. Several recurrent ROHs harbor genes associated with risk of TC. All of the ROHs showed significant evidence for natural selection (iHS, Fst, Fay and Wu's H). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the existence of recessive alleles in TC susceptibility. Although regions of homozygosity were rather small, it might be possible that variants within these ROHs affect TC risk and may function in a recessive manner.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the emergence and development of the “smart energy city” as an academic, normative, and applied concept. An examination of the academic literature since the early 2000s reveals the unfolding of spatiotemporal trends relating to this concept. It has been emerging to represent a sector-specified version of its sister concept of smart cities, also popularized in the past decade. However, the idea of the smart energy city has its own historic precursors and nationally specific trajectories. It rose from concerns with energy efficient/green buildings as well as smart grids for low carbon and distributed energy generation and distribution, which were later scaled up to the whole urban scale, and to embrace multiple other urban sectors and urban domains. By so doing, and combining the developments in ICT-led smart cities and sustainable energy, the notion of the smart energy city has come close to represent a digitally-mediated variant of low carbon cities. It can, thus, be conceptualized as a blend of smart cities and low carbon cities. National and urban case studies help to further distinguish “actually existing” projects, patterns, and conceptualization relating to both smart cities and smart energy cities and barriers to their practical integration. A greater focus on intersystem integration and a multistakeholder approach more recently offers a stronger representation of interdisciplinarity and conveys the complexity of the system involved, where humans and social systems become increasingly more central.},

Regarding rs3775290 of TLR3, susceptibilities of the severe type of T-possessing individuals were larger than those of C-possessing individuals [OR = 1.34, 95\%CI (1.10, 1.64), P = .004]. The susceptibility of individuals with the severe TT genotype was 1.61 times that of individuals with the CC genotype [95\%CI (1.07, 2.43), P=0.02], while susceptibility to HFMD was not influenced by the genotype. In terms of the rs3853839 of the TLR7 gene, C allele carriers have a higher risk of developing HFMD than G allele carriers. The susceptibility to HFMD in CC+CG individuals was 1.24 times than that in GG individuals [95\%CI (1.07, 1.43), P = .004]. However, no relationship was found between this polymorphism and severity of the severe type. No significant publication bias was observed in this study.           Conclusions:~           rs3775290 (C/T) of TLR3 is associated with susceptibility to the severe type, whereas rs3853839 (C/G) of TLR7 is associated with susceptibility to HFMD. However, owing to the limited quantity and quality of the research, the aforementioned conclusions are yet to be justified by more high-quality research.},

  abstract = {Smart cities have emerged as a possible solution to sustainability problems deriving from rapid urbanization. They are considered imperative for a sustainable future. Despite their recent popularity, the literature reveals the lack of conceptual clarity around the term of smart city, due to the plethora of existing definitions. This comprehensive literature review has identified 43 smart city definitions assessed according to the dimensions of sustainability that they consider, environmental, economic or social, and the priority in which they accord the concept of sustainability. The study revealed the common and opposite characteristics of the definitions according to the sustainability dimensions they consider and discussed the limitations they present. Such limitations appear to be related to citizen accessibility, misrepresentation and the particularity of existing urban fabrics. Taking into account these issues, as well as the difference between the smart city vision and its actual implementation, a new updated definition is proposed. The findings of the present study contribute to knowledge and practice by aiding conceptual clarity and, in particular, by drawing attention to underlying assumptions about the role of sustainability in smart city development.},

  abstract = {Objective:~           To determine the association between human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-G genotypes and resistance or susceptibility to HIV-1.           Design:~           A group of sex workers in Pumwani, Kenya can be epidemiologically defined as resistant to HIV-1 infection despite frequent exposure and provide an example of natural protective immunity. HLA class I and II molecules have been shown to be associated with resistance/susceptibility to infection in this cohort. HLA-G is a nonclassical class I allele that is primarily involved in mucosal and inflammatory response, which is of interest in HIV-1 resistance.           Methods:~           In this study, we used a sequence-based typing method to genotype HLA-G for 667 women enrolled in this cohort and examined the influence of HLA-G genotypes on resistance or susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.           Results:~           The G*01 : 01:01 genotype was significantly enriched in the HIV-1-resistant women [P = 0.002, Odds ratio: 2.11, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.259–0.976], whereas the G*01 : 04:04 genotype was significantly associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection (P = 0.039, OR:0.502, 95\% CI:0.259–0.976). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis correlated with these results. G*01 : 01:01 genotype was associated with significantly lower rate of seroconversion (P = 0.001). Whereas, G*01 : 04:04 genotype was significantly associated with an increased rate of seroconversion (P = 0.013). The associations of these HLA-G alleles are independent of other HLA class I and II alleles identified in this population.           Conclusion:~           Our study showed that specific HLA-G alleles are associated with resistance or susceptibility to HIV-1 acquisition in this high-risk population. Further studies are needed to understand its functional significance in HIV-1 transmission.},

These devices have been demonstrated to be clinically valuable, improving glycemic control and reducing risks of hypoglycemia in ambulatory patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 30-40\% of patients with type 1 diabetes and an increasing number of insulin-requiring patients with type 2 diabetes are using pump and sensor technology. As the popularity of these devices increases, it becomes very likely that hospital health care providers will face the need to manage the inpatient care of patients under insulin pump therapy and CGM. The American Diabetes Association advocates allowing patients who are physically and mentally able to continue to use their pumps when hospitalized. Health care institutions must have clear policies and procedures to allow the patient to continue to receive CSII treatment to maximize safety and to comply with existing regulations related to self-management of medication. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether CSII therapy and CGM systems in the hospital are associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with intermittent monitoring and conventional insulin treatment or with a favorable cost-benefit ratio.},

  abstract = {The risk of mortality or significant moridity is high among long-stay intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Sepsis, polyneuropathy and multiple organ failure are prominent causes of mortality and morbidity in the ICU. Many ICU patients are hyperglycaemic, presumably reflecting an adaptive development of insulin resistance. We hypothesized that this hyperglycaemia predisposes patients to many of the typical ICU complications, prolonged intensive care dependence and excess mortality. Insulin therapy directed at establishing normoglycaemia was investigated in a series of 1548 ICU patients. An intensive treatment group received insulin infusion tailored to control blood glucose levels in the range 4.4-6.1 mmol/l (80-110 mg/dl), whereas the conventional treatment group only received insulin when glucose levels exceeded 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) and in that event were maintained in a target range of 10.0-11.1 mmol/l (180-200 mg/dl). Intensive management of blood glucose levels was reflected in a 43\% reduction in intensive care mortality risk (P=0.036 after correction for interim analyses) and a 34\% reduction in hospital mortality (P=0.01). A reduced risk of infection was reflected in a 46\% reduction in the risk of septicaemia (P=0.003) and a 35\% reduction in the need for prolonged ({$>$}10 d) antibiotic therapy (P{$<$}0.001). Regression analysis suggests that control of glucose levels, rather than insulin administration itself, was responsible for the clinical benefits observed. Use of insulin infusion to control glucose levels in ICU patients, at least in populations similar to those in our study, can be expected to achieve clinically welcome improvements in outcome. An algorithm is proposed for implementing this. Further data are needed to establish the applicability of this strategy to other patient groups in the ICU and in general hospital care.},

This study uses primary survey data collected by the authors along a bus route in Montreal, Canada, to assess whether users’ image of public transit is associated with their satisfaction and intention to continue using public transit in the future. Two binary logit models are developed and the results reveal that having a positive image of transit increases users’ odds of being satisfied and of intending to continue using transit in the future. Results also suggest that previous transit usage is a good indicator of intended future usage. Furthermore, this study explores whether the users’ image of transit should be considered when assessing loyalty. Based on our findings, we suggest that loyalty constructs in public transit research should be composed of the users’ image of public transit, their overall satisfaction with a service, their willingness to recommend it to others, and, passengers’ intentions to continue using the service in the future. Overall, this study is useful for researchers and transit agencies aiming to better understand and increase loyalty among current and future public transit users.},

  abstract = {An estimated 37 million people globally suffer from Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) infection with 1.7 million newly acquired infections occurring on average each year. Although crucial advances in combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the last two decades have transformed an HIV-1 diagnosis into a tolerable and controlled condition, enabling over 20 million people living with HIV-1 to enjoy healthy and productive lives, no cure or vaccine yet exists. Developing a successful cure strategy will require a firm understanding of how viral latency is established and how a persistent and long-lived latent is generated. The latent reservoir remains the primary obstacle for cure development and most putative cure strategies proposed fundamentally address its eradication or permanent suppression.},

The majority of patients had self-limited mild-to-moderate uncomplicated disease. However, some patients developed severe illness and some died. In addition to respiratory complications, several complications due to direct and indirect effects on other body systems were associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. The main complications reported in hospitalized adults with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were pneumonia (primary influenza pneumonia and concomitant/secondary bacterial pneumonia), exacerbations of chronic pulmonary diseases (mainly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma), the need for intensive unit care admission (including mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock), nosocomial infections and acute cardiac events. In experimentally infected animals, the level of pulmonary replication of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was higher than that of seasonal influenza viruses. Pathological studies in autopsy specimens indicated that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus mainly targeted the lower respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage (edema, hyaline membranes, inflammation, and fibrosis), manifested clinically by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with refractory hypoxemia. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia and other complications were associated with increased morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients.},

  abstract = {The hall mark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a gradual loss of CD4+ T-cells and imbalance in CD4+ T-cell homeostasis, with progressive impairment of immunity that leads ultimately to death. HIV infection in humans is caused by two related yet distinct viruses: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-2 is typically less virulent than HIV-1 and permits the host to mount a more effective and sustained T-cell immunity. Although both infections manifest the same clinical spectrum, the much lower rate of CD4+ T-cell decline and slower progression of disease in HIV-2 infected individuals have grabbed the attention of several researchers. Here, we review the most recent findings on the differential rate of decline of CD4+ T-cell in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections and provide plausible reasons for the observed differences between the two groups.},

Rapid detection and assessment of new variants has become one of the principal objectives of genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. Because of the pace and scale of sequencing, new strategies have been developed for characterizing fitness and transmissibility of emerging variants. In this Review, I discuss a wide range of approaches that have been rapidly developed in response to the public health threat posed by emerging variants, ranging from new applications of classic population genetics models to contemporary synthesis of epidemiological models and phylodynamic analysis. Many of these approaches can be adapted to other pathogens and will have increasing relevance as large-scale pathogen sequencing becomes a regular feature of many public health~systems.},

The authors conclude that, first, capacity building is a useful conceptual focus for understanding sustainability implementation in U.S. cities. Capacity building involves developing technical and financial support and increasing managerial execution. Second, sustainability is strongly associated with managerial capacity, which includes establishing sustainability goals, incorporating goals in operations, and developing a supportive infrastructure. Third, getting stakeholders involved furthers the capacity for sustaining sustainability efforts. Citizen involvement is strongly associated with securing financial support for sustainability.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies typically test large numbers of genetic variants in association with trait values. It is well known that linkage disequilibrium (LD) between nearby markers tends to introduce correlation among association tests. Failure to properly adjust for multiple comparisons can lead to false-positive results or missing true-positive signals. The Bonferroni correction is generally conservative in the presence of LD. The permutation procedure, although has been widely employed to adjust for correlated tests, is not applicable when related individuals are included in case-control samples. With related individuals, the dependence among relatives' genotypes can also contribute to the correlation between tests. We present a new method P(norm) to correct for multiple hypothesis testing in case-control association studies in which some individuals are related. The adjustment with P(norm) simultaneously accounts for two sources of correlations of the test statistics: (1) LD among genetic markers (2) dependence among genotypes across related individuals. Using simulated data based on the International HapMap Project, we demonstrate that it has better control of type I error and is more powerful than some of the recently developed methods. We apply the method to a genome-wide association study of alcoholism in the GAW 14 COGA data set and detect genome-wide significant association.},

To better understand ROH and its relationship with lung cancer, we performed a genome-wide ROH analysis of a subset of a previous genome-wide case-control study (1,473 cases and 1,962 controls) in a Han Chinese population. ROHs were classified into two classes, based on lengths, intermediate and long ROHs, to evaluate their association with lung cancer risk using existing genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. We found that the overall level of intermediate ROHs was significantly associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio = 0.63; 95\% confidence interval: 0.51-0.77; P = 4.78×10(-6) ), while the long ROHs seemed to be a risk factor of lung cancer. We also identified one ROH region at 14q23.1 that was consistently associated with lung cancer risk in the study. These results indicated that ROHs may be a new class of variation which may be associated with lung cancer risk, and genetic variants at 14q23.1 may be involved in the development of lung cancer.},

  abstract = {Rhinovirus (RV), a single-stranded RNA picornavirus, is the most frequent cause of asthma exacerbations. We previously demonstrated in human bronchial epithelial cells that melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA)-5 and the adaptor protein for Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 are each required for maximal RV1B-induced interferon (IFN) responses. However, in vivo, the overall airway response to viral infection likely represents a coordinated response integrating both antiviral and pro-inflammatory pathways. We examined the airway responses of MDA5- and TLR3-deficient mice to infection with RV1B, a minor group virus which replicates in mouse lungs. MDA5 null mice showed a delayed type I IFN and attenuated type III IFN response to RV1B infection, leading to a transient increase in viral titer. TLR3 null mice showed normal IFN responses and unchanged viral titers. Further, RV-infected MDA5 and TLR3 null mice showed reduced lung inflammatory responses and reduced airways responsiveness. Finally, RV-infected MDA5 null mice with allergic airways disease showed lower viral titers despite deficient IFN responses, and allergic MDA5 and TLR3 null mice each showed decreased RV-induced airway inflammatory and contractile responses. These results suggest that, in the context of RV infection, binding of viral dsRNA to MDA5 and TLR3 initiates pro-inflammatory signaling pathways leading to airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness., Rhinovirus (RV) is the most frequent cause of acute respiratory tract infection in humans. RV has emerged as the most frequent pathogen associated with exacerbations of asthma. However, the mechanisms by which RV causes asthma flare-ups are not precisely known. We studied the requirements of two receptors which bind viral double-stranded RNA, melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA)-5 and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, for RV-induced airway responses using specific knockout mice. We found that MDA5 and TLR3 deficiencies had modest effects on viral titer. However, MDA5 and TLR3 knockout mice showed significantly reduced airway inflammation and responsiveness in response to RV infection. Mice with allergic airways disease also showed reduced airway responses. These results suggest that, in the context of RV infection, TLR3 and MDA5 initiate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways which lead to airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.},

  abstract = {Introduction Recent studies examining the association of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene polymorphisms with the risk of developing various types of cancer have reported conflicting results. Clarifying this association could advance our knowledge of the influence of TLR3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on cancer risk. Methods We systematically reviewed studies that focused on a collection of 12 SNPs located in the TLR3 gene and the details by which these SNPs influenced cancer risk. Additionally, 14 case-control studies comprising a total of 7997 cases of cancer and 8699 controls were included in a meta-analysis of 4 highly studied SNPs (rs3775290, rs3775291, rs3775292, and rs5743312). Results The variant TLR3 genotype rs5743312 (C9948T, intron 3, C\,{$>$}\,T) was significantly associated with an increased cancer risk as compared with the wild-type allele (odds ratio [OR]\,=\,1.11, 95~\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,1.00–1.24, P\,=\,0.047). No such association was observed with other TLR3 SNPs. In the stratified analysis, the rs3775290 (C13766T, C\,{$>$}\,T) variant genotype was found to be significantly associated with an increased cancer risk in Asian populations. Additionally, the rs3775291 (G13909A, G\,{$>$}\,A) variant genotype was significantly associated with an increased cancer risk in Asians, subgroup with hospital-based controls, and subgroup with a small sample size. Conclusion After data integration, our findings suggest that the TLR3 rs5743312 polymorphism may contribute to an increased cancer risk.},

We investigated the involvement of Toll-like receptor (Tlr) 3, which recognizes viral double-stranded (ds)RNA, on WNV infection. Tlr3-deficient (Tlr3(-/-)) mice were more resistant to lethal WNV infection and had impaired cytokine production and enhanced viral load in the periphery, whereas in the brain, viral load, inflammatory responses and neuropathology were reduced compared to wild-type mice. Peripheral WNV infection led to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and enhanced brain infection in wild-type but not in Tlr3(-/-) mice, although both groups were equally susceptible upon intracerebroventricular administration of the virus. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor 1 signaling is vital for blood-brain barrier compromise upon Tlr3 stimulation by dsRNA or WNV. Collectively, WNV infection leads to a Tlr3-dependent inflammatory response, which is involved in brain penetration of the virus and neuronal injury.},

Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8\% of cases with severe courses, and 6.1\% of cases with critical courses3. This severe presentation may result from the virus using a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4; the same receptor tropism is thought to have determined the pathogenicity-but also aided in the control-of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of cases of COVID-19 in which the patient shows mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which suggests the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6-8. There is an urgent need for information on virus replication, immunity and infectivity in specific sites of the body. Here we report a detailed virological analysis of nine cases of COVID-19 that provides proof of active virus replication in tissues of the upper respiratory tract. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms, with a peak at 7.11~×~108~RNA copies per throat swab on day~4. Infectious virus was readily isolated from samples derived from the throat or lung, but not from stool samples-in spite of high concentrations of virus RNA. Blood and urine samples never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by the presence of viral replicative RNA intermediates in the throat samples. We consistently detected sequence-distinct virus populations in throat and lung samples from one patient, proving independent replication. The shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7~days in 50\% of patients (and by day~14 in all patients), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild illness of the upper respiratory tract. The confirmation of active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract has implications for the containment of COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review To provide an update on the origin of the HIV epidemic and insights into how the immune response is shaping virus evolution. Recent findings Characterization of archival samples showed that by the 1960s, HIV had already diverged within humans. It is now estimated that HIV has been in humans since at least the early 1900s. However, despite the potential for different divergent viruses to spread, surprisingly few viruses successfully expanded to cause the global epidemic. In approximately 80\% of cases, productive infection is the result of infection with only a single virus or single virus-infected cell. After transmission, HIV evolves at a rapid rate driven by the immune pressure until the virus reaches a delicate survival balance: on one hand avoiding elimination through the development of cytotoxic T-cell immune escape mutations, and on the other sacrificing replication fitness as these mutations may come with a severe fitness cost to the virus. People infected with these ‘attenuated’ cytotoxic T-cell escape viruses can have a survival advantage. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are molding HIV diversity at a population level resulting in a loss of some of the common immune epitopes. Summary Insights into the origin of HIV and its evolution between populations and within individuals is essential to understanding HIV pathogenesis and imperative for the design of effective biomedical interventions such as vaccines.},

In this novel study, we investigate the effect of China's smart city policy on household daily consumption and carbon emissions. The empirical analysis is based on a difference-in-differences regression, in which the dependent variable is the household indirect carbon emissions estimated based on the consumer lifestyle approach and a dataset of 201 Chinese cities between 2010 and 2018. The main findings are as follows. First, the smart city policy significantly reduces household indirect carbon emissions, and the reduction is greater when the policy pilot region includes the whole city rather than only certain subareas. Second, the mechanisms through which the smart city influences household indirect carbon emissions are mainly the reductions in transportation- and education-related emissions resulting from developments in smart technology. Third, the above effects last for years, and they are regionally heterogeneous and more significant in the cities of eastern China. The findings in this paper suggest that smart cities can potentially achieve city sustainability by promoting greener consumption behavior.},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and host immune response determine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but studies evaluating viral evasion of immune response are lacking. Here, we use unbiased screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that antagonize type I interferon (IFN-I) response. We found three proteins that antagonize IFN-I production via distinct mechanisms: nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) binds TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to suppress interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, nsp13 binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation, and open reading frame 6 (ORF6) binds importin Karyopherin α 2 (KPNA2) to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation. We identify two sets of viral proteins that antagonize IFN-I signaling through blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)/STAT2 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2~nsp1 and nsp6 suppress IFN-I signaling more efficiently than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Thus, when treated with IFN-I, a SARS-CoV-2 replicon replicates to a higher level than chimeric replicons containing nsp1 or nsp6 from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Altogether, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2 evasion of IFN-I response and its potential impact on viral transmission and pathogenesis., Xia et~al. perform an unbiased screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that antagonize the IFN-I response. The identified viral proteins inhibit IFN-I production and signaling through distinct mechanisms. Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the IFN-I signaling is more efficiently suppressed by the SARS-CoV-2~nsp1 and nsp6 proteins.},

  abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection varies in the outcomes depending on both viral and host factors. This study aims to investigate the associations of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), rs179016, rs5743733, and rs1634323, with susceptibility to HCV infection and clearance. The three SNPs were genotyped in a high-risk Chinese population, including 444 HCV spontaneous clearance cases, 732 persistent infection cases, and 1107 healthy controls. The G allele of rs1634323 was related to the protection from persistent infection among females (dominant model: odds ratio (OR)\,=\,0.558, 95 \% confidence interval (CI)\,=\,0.348–0.894, P\,=\,0.015). This protective effect was more evident in blood donation and HCV non-1 genotype-infected subgroups (all P\,{$<$}\,0.05). The carriage of rs179016 C allele was more prone to develop persistent infection (OR\,=\,1.444, 95 \% CI\,=\,1.096–1.903, P\,=\,0.009) in males, and the risk effect remained significant among older ({$>$}50 years), hemodialysis (HD), and HCV-1 and HCV non-1 genotypes-infected subjects (all P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Haplotype analyses showed that CCA haplotype among females was correlated with the elevated risk of HCV susceptibility while the carriage of GGA was more prone to be infected with HCV and CCA was more likely to develop persistent infection (all P\,{$<$}\,0.05) among males. Our results first demonstrated that the carriage of rs179016 C allele had a negative effect on spontaneous clearance of HCV among males while rs1634323 G allele conferred a protective effect against persistent infection among female subjects.},

However, the cellular RNA-binding proteins involved in the establishment and maintenance of latent HIV-1 reservoirs have not been extensively studied. Here, we screened a panel of 62 cellular RNA-binding proteins and identified NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) as a potent interferon-inducible inhibitor of HIV-1 in primary T cells and macrophages. N4BP1 harbours a prototypical PilT N terminus-like RNase domain and inhibits HIV-1 replication by interacting with and degrading viral mRNA species. Following activation of CD4+ T cells, however, N4BP1 undergoes rapid cleavage at Arg\,509 by the paracaspase named mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 (MALT1). Mutational analyses and knockout studies revealed that MALT1-mediated inactivation of N4BP1 facilitates the reactivation of latent HIV-1 proviruses. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the RNase N4BP1 is an efficient restriction factor of HIV-1 and suggest that inactivation of N4BP1 by induction of MALT1 activation might facilitate elimination of latent HIV-1 reservoirs.},

  abstract = {Bergenin is a natural PPARγ agonist that can prevent neutrophil aggregation, and often be used in clinics for treating respiratory diseases. Recent data show that Th17 cells are important for neutrophil aggregation and asthma through secreting IL-17A. In this study, we investigated the effects of bergenin on Th17 differentiation in vitro and subsequent neutrophilic asthma in mice. Naïve T cells isolated from mouse mesenteric lymph nodes were treated with IL-23, TGF-β, and IL-6 to induce Th17 differentiation. We showed that in naïve T cells under Th17-polarizing condition, the addition of bergenin (3, 10, 30\,μM) concentration-dependently decreased the percentage of CD4+ IL-17A+ T cells and mRNA expression of specific transcription factor RORγt, and function-related factors IL-17A/F, IL-21, and IL-22, but did not affect the cell vitality and apoptosis. Furthermore, bergenin treatment prevented GLS1-dependent glutaminolysis in the progress of Th17 differentiation, slightly affected the levels of SLC1A5, SLC38A1, GLUD1, GOT1, and GPT2. Glutamine deprivation, the addition of glutamate (1\,mM), α-ketoglutarate (1\,mM), or GLS1 plasmid all significantly attenuated the above-mentioned actions of bergenin. Besides, we demonstrated that bergenin (3, 10, and 30\,μM) concentration-dependently activated PPARγ in naïve T cells, whereas PPARγ antagonist GW9662 and siPPARγ abolished bergenin-caused inhibition on glutaminolysis and Th17 differentiation. Furthermore, we revealed that bergenin inhibited glutaminolysis by regulating the level of CDK1, phosphorylation and degradation of Cdh1, and APC/C-Cdh1-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of GLS1 after activating PPARγ. We demonstrated a correlation existing among bergenin-affected GLS1-dependent glutaminolysis, PPARγ, “CDK1-APC/C-Cdh1” signaling, and Th17 differentiation. Finally, the therapeutic effect and mechanisms for bergenin-inhibited Th17 responses and neutrophilic asthma were confirmed in a mouse model of neutrophilic asthma by administration of GW9662 or GLS1 overexpression plasmid in vivo. In conclusion, bergenin repressed Th17 differentiation and then alleviated neutrophilic asthma in mice by inhibiting GLS1-dependent glutaminolysis via regulating the “CDK1-APC/C-Cdh1” signaling after activating PPARγ.},

  abstract = {An artificial strong hydrophobic signal peptide (ASP), containing ten leucines in tandem in the hydrophobic core, was utilized to replace the wild type signal peptide (WTSP) of penicillin G acylase (PAC), by the fusion to its 4 pro site. PAC expression plasmids, including pKKpacdeltaSP, pKKpacWTSP, pKKpacASP, pETpacWTSP and pETpacASP, were constructed. The length and the amino- and carboxyl-terminus amino acid composition of ASP and WTSP were kept identical. The activity assay and Western-blotting analysis were used to study the effect of ASP and WTSP on the secretion of PAC in tac, T7 and dissolved-oxygen regulation expression systems, respectively. Lack of signal peptide in pKKpacdeltaSP resulted in the accumulation of 91 kD PAC precursor (without signal peptide, but with the space peptide between alpha-subunit and beta-subunit) in the cytosol, indicating that the secretion of PAC depends on the signal peptide. In BL21(pKKpacASP) cells, the PAC activity and proprecursor (with signal peptide and space peptide) processing capacity were increased by about 54\% and 38.5\%, respectively, in comparison with BL21(pKKpacWTSP) cells. Compared with BL21(DE3) (pETpacWTSP), however, the PAC activity and proprecursor processing capacity in BL21(DE3) (pETpacASP) were enhanced by about 69\% and 43.5\%, respectively. The PAC activity expressed from pETpacASP was about 67\% more than that from pETpacWTSP in the dissolved-oxygen-regulated expression system GJ100. Resulting from the strong hydrophobicity of ASP, therefore, the PAC activity and proprecursor processing capacity were increased by about 63\% and 41\% on average, respectively, in comparison with WTSP. In conclusion, the increase in hydrophobicity of the signal peptide hydrophobic core enhanced the secretion of penicillin G acylase.},

However, the susceptibility of the brain to SARS-CoV-2, and the mechanisms underlying neurological infection are still elusive. Here, we utilized human embryonic stem cell-derived brain organoids and monolayer cortical neurons to investigate infection of brain with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Spike-containing SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infected neural layers within brain organoids. The expression of ACE2, a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was sustained during the development of brain organoids, especially in the somas of mature neurons, while remaining rare in neural stem cells. However, pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the axon of neurons, which lack ACE2. Neural infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus did not increase in proportion to viral load, but only 10\% of neurons were infected. Our findings demonstrate that brain organoids provide a useful model for investigating SARS-CoV-2 entry into the human brain and elucidating the susceptibility of the brain to SARS-CoV-2.},

Since its first appearance in December 2019, the outbreak has already caused over 5.8 million infections worldwide (till 29 May 2020), with more than 0.35 million deaths. Early virus-mediated immune suppression is believed to be one of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes at least partially to the viral pathogenesis. In this study, we identified the key viral interferon antagonists of SARS-CoV-2 and compared them with two well-characterized SARS-CoV interferon antagonists, PLpro and orf6. Here we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, nsp14, nsp15 and orf6, but not the unique orf8, could potently suppress primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Although SARS-CoV PLpro has been well-characterized for its potent interferon-antagonizing, deubiquitinase and protease activities, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, despite sharing high amino acid sequence similarity with SARS-CoV, loses both interferon-antagonising and deubiquitinase activities. Among the 27 viral proteins, SARS-CoV-2 orf6 demonstrated the strongest suppression on both primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Orf6-deleted SARS-CoV-2 may be considered for the development of intranasal live-but-attenuated vaccine against COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Signal peptides that direct protein export in Bacillus subtilis are overall more hydrophobic than signal peptides in Escherichia coli. To study the importance of signal peptide hydrophobicity for protein export in both organisms, the alpha-amylase AmyQ was provided with leucine-rich (high hydrophobicity) or alanine-rich (low hydrophobicity) signal peptides. AmyQ export was most efficiently directed by the authentic signal peptide, both in E. coli and B. subtilis. The leucine-rich signal peptide directed AmyQ export less efficiently in both organisms, as judged from pulse-chase labelling experiments. Remarkably, the alanine-rich signal peptide was functional in protein translocation only in E. coli. Cross-linking of in vitro synthesized ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) to cytoplasmic proteins showed that signal peptide hydrophobicity is a critical determinant for signal peptide binding to the Ffh component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) or to trigger factor, not only in E. coli, but also in B. subtilis. The results show that B. subtilis SRP can discriminate between signal peptides with relatively high hydrophobicities. Interestingly, the B. subtilis protein export machinery seems to be poorly adapted to handle alanine-rich signal peptides with a low hydrophobicity. Thus, signal peptide hydrophobicity appears to be more critical for the efficiency of early stages in protein export in B. subtilis than in E. coli.},

  abstract = {Background Although hundreds of different signal peptides have now been identified, few studies have examined the factors enabling signal peptides to augment secretion of mature proteins. Signal peptides, located at the N-terminus of nascent secreted proteins, characteristically have three domains: (1) a basic domain at the N-terminus, (2) a central hydrophobic core, and (3) a carboxy-terminal cleavage region. In this study, we investigated whether alterations in the basic and/or the hydrophobic domains of a commonly used signal peptide from interleukin-2 (IL-2) affected secretion of two proteins: placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) and endostatin. Methods A series of modifications in the basic and/or hydrophobic domains of the IL-2 signal peptide were made by polymerase chain reaction with endostatin or AP plasmids as templates. Transfection of wild-type or modified IL-2 signal peptides fused in-frame with endostatin or AP were done with Superfect in vitro or by the hydrodynamic method in vivo. Results Increasing both the basicity and hydrophobicity of the signal peptide augmented the secretion of AP and endostatin by approximately 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively, from MDA-MB-435 cells in vitro. Over a range of DNA concentrations and times, the most effective IL-2 signal peptide increased AP levels in the medium compared to the wild-type IL-2 signal peptide. Comparable results from these modified IL-2 signal peptides were found to increase AP levels in the medium from bovine aortic endothelial cells. Moreover, the combined changes in basic and hydrophobic domains of the IL-2 signal peptide augmented serum levels of endostatin and placental AP by 3-fold when the optimal plasmid constructs were injected in vivo. Conclusions Modification of the IL-2 signal peptide augments protein secretion both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, optimizing the signal peptide should be considered for increasing the therapeutic levels of secreted proteins. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Missense mutations may affect proteostasis by destabilizing or over-stabilizing protein complexes and changing the pathway flux. Predicting the effects of stabilizing mutations on protein-protein interactions is notoriously difficult because existing experimental sets are skewed toward mutations reducing protein-protein binding affinity and many computational methods fail to correctly evaluate their effects. To address this issue, we developed a method MutaBind2, which estimates the impacts of single as well as multiple mutations on protein-protein interactions. MutaBind2 employs only seven features, and the most important of them describe interactions of proteins with the solvent, evolutionary conservation of the site, and thermodynamic stability of the complex and each monomer. This approach shows a distinct improvement especially in evaluating the effects of mutations increasing binding affinity. MutaBind2 can be used for finding disease driver mutations, designing stable protein complexes, and discovering new protein-protein interaction inhibitors.,                                        •               A new method to predict binding affinity changes upon single and multiple mutations                                         •               Improved performance in evaluating the effects of mutations increasing binding affinity                                         •               Generation of the structural model of a mutant complex                                 , Protein Folding; Bioinformatics; 3D Reconstruction of Protein},

  abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions play important roles in regulations of many vital cellular processes, including transcription, translation, DNA replication and recombination. Sequence variants occurring in these DNA binding proteins that alter protein-DNA interactions may cause significant perturbations or complete abolishment of function, potentially leading to diseases. Developing a mechanistic understanding of impacts of variants on protein-DNA interactions becomes a persistent need. To address this need we introduce a new computational method PremPDI that predicts the effect of single missense mutation in the protein on the protein-DNA interaction and calculates the quantitative binding affinity change. The PremPDI method is based on molecular mechanics force fields and fast side-chain optimization algorithms with parameters optimized on experimental sets of 219 mutations from 49 protein-DNA complexes. PremPDI yields a very good agreement between predicted and experimental values with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 and root-mean-square error of 0.86 kcal mol-1. The PremPDI server could map mutations on a structural protein-DNA complex, calculate the associated changes in binding affinity, determine the deleterious effect of a mutation, and produce a mutant structural model for download. PremPDI can be applied to many tasks, such as determination of potential damaging mutations in cancer and other diseases. PremPDI is available at http://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPDI/., Developing methods for accurate prediction of effects of amino acid substitutions on protein-DNA interactions is important for a wide range of biomedical applications such as understanding disease-causing mechanism of missense mutations and guiding protein engineering. Very few methods have been developed for predicting the effects of mutations on protein-DNA binding affinity. Here we report a new computational method, PRedicts the Effects of single Mutations on Protein-DNA Interactions (PremPDI). The core of the PremPDI method is based on molecular mechanics force fields and fast side-chain optimization algorithms that makes the PremPDI algorithm efficient and being fast enough to handle large number of cases. The performance of the PremPDI protocol was tested against experimentally determined binding free energy changes of 219 mutations from 49 protein-DNA complexes and yields very good correlation coefficient. The PremPDI webserver is available to the community at http://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPDI/.},

  abstract = {Summary: Genome-wide association studies are widely used to investigate the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they pose many computational challenges. We developed gdsfmt and SNPRelate (R packages for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures) to accelerate two key computations on SNP data: principal component analysis (PCA) and relatedness analysis using identity-by-descent measures. The kernels of our algorithms are written in C/C++ and highly optimized. Benchmarks show the uniprocessor implementations of PCA and identity-by-descent are ∼8–50 times faster than the implementations provided in the popular EIGENSTRAT (v3.0) and PLINK (v1.07) programs, respectively, and can be sped up to 30–300-fold by using eight cores. SNPRelate can analyse tens of thousands of samples with millions of SNPs. For example, our package was used to perform PCA on 55 324 subjects from the ‘Gene-Environment Association Studies’ consortium studies.Availability and implementation: gdsfmt and SNPRelate are available from R CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org), including a vignette.

  abstract = {TLR7 has been linked to the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis, but its precise roles are not clear. In this study, we evaluated the roles of TLR7 in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). TLR7 proteins were abundant in CD19+ B cells infiltrated in the kidneys of patients with IgAN. The intensities of both intrarenal TLR7 and CD19 proteins were closely associated with kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] and serum creatinine concentration) and renal histopathology (tubular atrophy, leukocyte infiltration, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and global glomerulosclerosis) in patients with IgAN. Meanwhile, TLR7 mRNA levels were significantly increased in peripheral blood B cells of patients with IgAN. TLR7+CD19+ B cells expressed inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-12) in kidneys and produced high levels of IgA1 and galactose deficient-IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) in peripheral blood of patients with IgAN. Mechanistically, TLR7 activated B cells to produce high levels of Gd-IgA1 via the TLR7-GALNT2 axis in IgAN. Protein levels of GALNT2 were increased by overexpression of TLR7, while they were reduced by TLR7 knockdown in B cells. GALNT2 overexpression augmented Gd-IgA1 production in B cells derived from patients with IgAN. Taken together, high TLR7 expression in B cells has dual roles in the development and progression of IgAN, by facilitating renal inflammation and Gd-IgA1 antibody synthesis., , TLR7 plays dual roles in pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy by facilitating renal inflammation and promoting the synthesis of Gd-IgA1 antibodies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Age-specific comparisons of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization rates can inform prevention efforts, including vaccine development plans. Previous US studies have not estimated jointly the burden of these viruses using similar data sources and over many seasons. METHODS: We estimated influenza and RSV hospitalizations in 5 age categories ({$<$}1, 1-4, 5-49, 50-64, and ≥65 years) with data for 13 states from 1993-1994 through 2007-2008. For each state and age group, we estimated the contribution of influenza and RSV to hospitalizations for respiratory and circulatory disease by using negative binomial regression models that incorporated weekly influenza and RSV surveillance data as covariates. RESULTS: Mean rates of influenza and RSV hospitalizations were 63.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 37.5-237) and 55.3 (95\% CI, 44.4-107) per 100000 person-years, respectively. The highest hospitalization rates for influenza were among persons aged ≥65 years (309/100000; 95\% CI, 186-1100) and those aged {$<$}1 year (151/100000; 95\% CI, 151-660). For RSV, children aged {$<$}1 year had the highest hospitalization rate (2350/100000; 95\% CI, 2220-2520) followed by those aged 1-4 years (178/100000; 95\% CI, 155-230). Age-standardized annual rates per 100000 person-years varied substantially for influenza (33-100) but less for RSV (42-77). CONCLUSIONS: Overall US hospitalization rates for influenza and RSV are similar; however, their age-specific burdens differ dramatically. Our estimates are consistent with those from previous studies focusing either on influenza or RSV. Our approach provides robust national comparisons of hospitalizations associated with these 2 viral respiratory pathogens by age group and over time.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Genome-wide association studies revealed that most disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are located in regulatory regions within introns or in regions between genes. Regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) are such SNPs that affect gene regulation by changing transcription factor (TF) binding affinities to genomic sequences. Identifying potential rSNPs is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. In silico methods that evaluate the impact of SNPs on TF binding affinities are not scalable for large-scale analysis.Results: We describe affinity testing for regulatory SNPs (atSNP), a computationally efficient R package for identifying rSNPs in silico. atSNP implements an importance sampling algorithm coupled with a first-order Markov model for the background nucleotide sequences to test the significance of affinity scores and SNP-driven changes in these scores. Application of atSNP with \&gt;20\,K SNPs indicates that atSNP is the only available tool for such a large-scale task. atSNP provides user-friendly output in the form of both tables and composite logo plots for visualizing SNP-motif interactions. Evaluations of atSNP with known rSNP-TF interactions indicate that SNP is able to prioritize motifs for a given set of SNPs with high accuracy.Availability and implementation: ~https://github.com/keleslab/atSNP.Contact: ~keles@stat.wisc.eduSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
